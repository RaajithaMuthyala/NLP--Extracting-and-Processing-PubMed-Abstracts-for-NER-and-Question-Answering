Abstract
"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a prevalent liver condition that can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis. It also poses a risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, underscoring the importance of identifying effective treatments. N-acetylcysteine, an inhibitor of glutathione depletion, shows promise in modulating intracellular glutathione biosynthesis and combating oxidative stress, making it a potentially beneficial therapy for liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This study assesses the impact of N-acetylcysteine on HepG2 cells which were induced into fatty liver cells was evaluated. HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM and seeded onto six-well plates at a density of 5 × 10"

"Coffee, tea and caffeinated foods are popular in the world due to their high amount of caffeine, which are consumed daily by people in large quantities, and their effects on the body, especially the liver, are somewhat unknown, so this study was done with the aim of relationship between coffee and tea consumption and dietary intake of Caffeine on the serum liver enzymes and lipid profile. In this cross-sectional study the information of 8889 participants aged 35-70 years who referred to the Rafsanjan Cohort Study (RCS), a population-based prospective cohort that is a part of the Prospective epidemiological research studies in Iran (PERSIAN), was used. Demographic characteristics, medical history, consumption of coffee and tea, caffeine intake, and laboratory tests were collected. Dichotomous logistics regression models were used using crude and adjusted models to investigate the relationship between coffee, tea consumption, and caffeine intake with liver enzymes and lipid profile. Out of 8889 participants 4678 (52.6%) were female and 4211 (47.4%) were male. In older people, especially men, the consumption of tea and coffee increased and has a direct relationship with the abnormality of total cholesterol (TC) (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.29). Also, it was observed that increased abnormal Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.52) and decreased abnormal serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.93) were significantly associated with a high intake of caffeine. The other variables related to lipid profile and liver enzymes increased with increasing consumption of coffee, tea and intake of caffeine in participants, but did not show a significant increase. A high intake of caffeine and coffee and tea can have adverse effects on some liver enzymes and blood factors. Therefore, care should be taken when using these materials."
"We investigated California mortality and social determinants of health, as measured by the Healthy Places Index (HPI), which is a composite measure of 23 indicators of neighborhood (census tract) economic conditions, education, transportation, housing, social capital, environmental pollution, built-environment, and access to health care. We aggregated deaths to 2010 census tract boundaries for leading causes, 2015 to 2019, and COVID-19, 2020-2021, from death certificates and populations from the American Community Survey, 2015 to 2019. We age-adjusted and stratified death rates by HPI deciles, age, gender, and race/ethnicity, and examined HPI dose-response with segmental regression. For all causes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, COVID-19, diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, injuries, and Alzheimer's disease (ages 65-74 years), mortality rates were inversely related to HPI decile. For all causes mortality, the rate ratio between the 1st and 10th decile (reference) was 1.63 (CI95%: 1.60-1.66), and, for COVID-19, the rate ratio was 7.61 (CI95%: 7.14-8.12). The population attributable fraction was 24% for all causes and 72% for COVID-19. Age, gender, race/ethnicity modified the steepness and shape of dose-response curves. The findings illustrate opportunities to incorporate area-based socioeconomic measures in routine public health surveillance, and to reinforce policies and programs that reduce health inequities."

"Liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, following pancreatic cancer. The 5-year overall survival rate for HCC remains relatively low. Currently, there are multiple treatment options available for HCC, including systemic drugs, minimally invasive local therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and arterial radioembolization (TARE), as well as surgical interventions like liver resection or transplantation. However, the effectiveness of drug delivery to the cancerous liver is hindered by pathophysiological changes in the organ. In order to address this challenge, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as promising platforms for delivering a diverse range of therapeutic drugs. LNPs offer various structural configurations that enhance their physical stability and enable them to accommodate different types of cargo with varying mechanical properties and degrees of hydrophobicity. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the current applications of LNPs in the development of anti-HCC therapies. By examining the existing research, we aim to shed light on the potential future directions and advancements in this field."
"Rates of alcohol-related mortality (including deaths attributed to chronic alcohol use as well as acute causes involving alcohol) have been increasing in the United States, particularly for certain population subgroups, such as women. This review summarizes associations of area-level social determinants of health with alcohol-related mortality. These determinants, measured at the community, county, or state level, include alcohol control policies, health care availability, and a community's socioeconomic environment. Examining multiple geographic levels illuminates how macro-level social determinants and local contexts contribute to alcohol-related mortality to inform intervention. Attention to the broad variety of social determinants of alcohol-related mortality could ultimately improve community health."
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death around the world. The Dietary Quality Index-International (DQI-I) is one of the indicators that shows changes in diet and its association with NCDs. The aim of this study is to measure the association between the DQI-I and major metabolic risk factors.

"Hepatitis C, caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), is a prevalent liver disease with severe outcomes, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Traditional diagnostic methods primarily detect antiviral antibodies (anti-HCV) or viral RNA, but these approaches have limitations. Anti-HCV antibodies may take 2-4 weeks to develop in acute cases and can be absent in some individuals, leading to undiagnosed early-stage infections. This poses significant challenges for public health, particularly in resource-limited settings where early detection is crucial. This article explores the development of biosensors engineered to directly detect HCV surface antigens, such as envelope proteins. These biosensors provide a promising solution for earlier and more accurate diagnosis by identifying viral components at the initial stages of infection. By focusing on direct detection of viral antigens, these innovations could enhance early diagnosis, facilitate timely intervention, and reduce virus transmission. We evaluate the advancements in biosensor technology over the past decade and their potential to improve HCV detection in clinical and field settings, ultimately supporting global efforts to eliminate HCV as a public health threat."

"Transplant oncology encompasses and utilizes liver transplantation (LT) in combination with other aspects of cancer care to offer improved long-term outcomes for patients with liver cancer, but not all patients have equal access and ability to undergo LT. Social determinants of health may negatively impact a patient's ability to receive liver-related oncologic care, including LT. This review highlights recent work exposing gaps in access to LT, including transplant oncology, and interventions to ameliorate these disparities."
"Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The unclear molecular mechanisms and complex in vivo microenvironment of tumors make it difficult to clarify the nature of cancer and develop effective treatments. Therefore, the development of new methods to effectively treat cancer is urgently needed and of great importance. Organ-on-a-chip (OoC) systems could be the breakthrough technology sought by the pharmaceutical industry to address ever-increasing research and development costs. The past decade has seen significant advances in the spatial modeling of cancer therapeutics related to OoC technology, improving physiological exposition criteria. This article aims to summarize the latest achievements and research results of cancer cell treatment simulated in a 3D microenvironment using OoC technology. To this end, we will first discuss the OoC system in detail and then demonstrate the latest findings of the cancer cell treatment study by Ooc and how this technique can potentially optimize better modeling of the tumor. The prospects of OoC systems in the treatment of cancer cells and their advantages and limitations are also among the other points discussed in this study."
The impact of clinical factors and social determinants of health on treatment patterns and health care costs among patients with HCC is unknown.
"The hip fracture causes significant disabilities in many elderly people. Many studies around the world have identified various risk factors for the hip fracture. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the risk factors of hip fractures. This study is a systematic review of risk factors for hip fractures. All published papers in English and Persian languages on patients in Iran and other countries between 2002 - 2022 were examined. The search strategy used keywords matching the mesh, including : predictors, hip fracture, and disability. Articles were selected from international databases (PubMed, Proquest ,Web of Sience, Scopus, Google scholar and Persian(Sid,Magiran), and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias. The study has identified several factors that were significantly correlated with the risk of hip fracture, including age, cigarette and alcohol consumption, visual and hearing problems, low BMI levels, history of falling, weakness, and diseases such as stroke, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, diabetes, dementia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, liver and kidney diseases, bone density, osteoporosis, vertebral fracture, and hyperthyroidism. However, the study did not find any significant correlations between the consumption of calcium and vitamin D, history of fractures, cognitive disorders, schizophrenia, and household income, and the risk of hip fracture. The results of this study reveal the determining role of some risk factors in hip fracture in older persons. Therefore, it is recommended that health policy makers provide the possibility of early intervention for some changeable factors."

"Smoking is the leading behavioural risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for more than 175 million deaths and nearly 4·30 billion years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2021. The pace of decline in smoking prevalence has slowed in recent years for many countries, and although strategies have recently been proposed to achieve tobacco-free generations, none have been implemented to date. Assessing what could happen if current trends in smoking prevalence persist, and what could happen if additional smoking prevalence reductions occur, is important for communicating the effect of potential smoking policies."
"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic medical condition that affects over 29.5 million people and accounts for $249 billion in social and health care costs annually. Prevalence is higher among young adults, males, sexual and gender minorities, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and the uninsured. Despite its high prevalence and societal impact, AUD is often overlooked in health care settings. This has resulted in insufficient implementation of AUD screening as well as low levels of treatment uptake. Addressing these challenges requires recognition of the current epidemiology of AUD and role of social determinants of health."
To investigate how individual social determinants of health (SDOH) and cumulative social disadvantage (CSD) affect survival and receipt of liver transplant (LT) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
"Understanding the association of social determinants of health with liver transplant listing and waitlist outcomes can inform health care policy and interventions aimed at improving access to care. We analyzed the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database merged with the Social Deprivation Index (SDI) to evaluate if the area of residence is associated with the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease incorporating sodium (MELD-Na) at the time of waitlist placement and outcomes following waitlisting, and if this varied based on sociodemographic variables. Compared to candidates residing in areas of low SDI, those residing in areas of high SDI (most socioeconomic disadvantage) had 11% higher adjusted likelihood (aOR [95% CI] = 1.11 [CI 1.05,1.17]) of being listed for transplant with a MELD-Na score ≥30; this was not statistically significant when also adjusted for race/ethnicity (aOR = 1.02 [0.97,1.08]). When stratified by race/ethnicity, residing in an area of high SDI was associated with a MELD-Na score ≥30 at the time of waitlisting among Hispanic White candidates (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.49). Candidates residing in areas of high SDI had an 8% lower chance (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.92 [0.88,0.96]) of undergoing a liver transplant, a 6% higher risk of death (aHR = 1.06 [1.002,1.13]), and a 20% higher risk (aHR = 1.20 [1.13,1.28]) of removal on the waitlist independent of race, ethnicity, insurance status, or sex. In the United States, residence in areas of high socioeconomic disadvantage is significantly associated with higher MELD-Na at the time of waitlisting among Hispanic White candidates. In addition, residence in areas of high socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with a higher risk of death or removal from the waitlist and lower chances of receiving a liver transplant after waitlist placement, particularly among Non-Hispanic White candidates and older candidates."
"As the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases within historically disadvantaged communities, it is imperative to better understand how intersectionality-defined as the complex, cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination (such as racism, sexism, and classism)-intersects and social determinants of health influence the patient's experiences within the medical system when navigating their disease. Culturally sensitive care is characterized by the ability to deliver patient-centered care that recognizes how the intersectionality of an individual's identities impacts their disease journey. An intentional consideration and sensitivity to this impact play important roles in providing an inclusive and welcoming space for historically disadvantaged individuals living with IBD and will help address health inequity in IBD. Cultural competence implies mastery of care that understands and respects values and beliefs across cultures, while cultural humility involves recognizing the complexity of cultural identity and engaging in an ongoing learning process from individual patient experiences. Heightening our patient care goals from cultural competence to cultural sensitivity allows healthcare professionals and the systems in which they practice to lead with cultural humility as they adopt a more inclusive and humble perspective when caring for patient groups with a diverse array of identities and cultures and to avoid maintaining the status quo of implicit and explicit biases that impede the delivery of quality IBD care. In this article, we review the literature on IBD care in historically disadvantaged communities, address culturally sensitive care, and propose a framework to incorporating cultural humility in IBD practices and research."
"Primary liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was the sixth leading cause of cancer death in the United States in 2023. Hispanic people constitute approximately 19% of the nation's total population according to the US Census. Hispanic patients have the highest relative incidence rates of liver cancer compared to non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks, a disparity frequently overlooked in cancer research. In this study, our primary objective was to analyze the potential underrepresentation of Hispanic individuals in liver cancer research databases. We identified databases that had liver cancer-specific studies and be population-based in the United States. Our search yielded 7 cancer genomic databases, which were analyzed according to incidence percentages across ethnicity and race categories. Our study included 3104 patients; ethnic data was not reported for 13.1% (n = 406) of the patients. Samples were predominantly from individuals who identified as Not Hispanic (81.0%), Hispanic individuals represented 5.9%. Race was reported as follows: non-Hispanic Whites (61.0%), Asians (22.0%), non-Hispanic Blacks (5.4%), Other (3.1%), Native American/American Indian/Alaska Native (0.4%), Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian (0.2%) and not reported (7.9%). These findings collectively underscore significant disparities in the representation of ethnic and racial groups, particularly Hispanics. Given the present racial and ethnic demographics of the US population and the projected surge in the Hispanic population in forthcoming years, it becomes imperative to address health disparities that may worsen without efforts to enhance proper inclusion in cancer research."
"Social determinants of health, both individual and structural, impact access to liver transplantation (LT). We aimed to evaluate the association between structural social determinants of health (SSDoH) and individual-level psychosocial factors (as measured by the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplant, SIPAT score) on failure to waitlist for LT. We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of 2762 patients evaluated for LT. SSDoH exposures included the Social Deprivation Index (SDI), the proportion of households on cash public assistance or supplemental nutrition assistance (% public assistance), and distance to the transplant center. Neighborhood SDI score in the highest quartile (OR 1.32, 95 % CI 1.07-1.63) and % on public assistance in the highest quartile (OR 1.41, 95 % CI 1.14-1.75) were associated with increased odds of not being waitlisted for LT. These associations remained significant after adjusting for individual psychosocial risk using SIPAT scores (≥21, high psychosocial risk). Highest quartile neighborhood SDI (OR 1.70, 95 % CI 1.13-2.54) and the highest quartile of % on public assistance (OR 1.67, 95 % CI 1.11-2.53) were also associated with increased odds of failure to waitlist for psychosocial reasons. However, these associations were no longer significant after adjusting for individual SIPAT scores. High-risk SIPAT scores were more prevalent in neighborhoods with the highest quartile of SSDoH measures. Transplant centers can design initiatives to build individual psychosocial support to mitigate the impact of structural barriers."

"Nutrient metabolism is regulated by several factors. Social determinants of health with or without genetics are the primary regulator of metabolism, and an unhealthy lifestyle affects all modulators and mediators, leading to the adaptation and finally to the exhaustion of cellular functions. Hepatic steatosis is defined by presence of fat in more than 5% of hepatocytes. In hepatocytes, fat is stored as triglycerides in lipid droplet. Hepatic steatosis results from a combination of multiple intracellular processes. In a healthy individual nutrient metabolism is regulated at several steps. It ranges from the selection of nutrients in a grocery store to the last step of consumption of ATP as an energy or as a building block of a cell as structural component. Several hormones, peptides, and genes have been described that participate in nutrient metabolism. Several enzymes participate in each nutrient metabolism as described above from ingestion to generation of ATP. As of now several publications have revealed very intricate regulation of nutrient metabolism, where most of the regulatory factors are tied to each other bidirectionally, making it difficult to comprehend chronological sequence of events. Insulin hormone is the primary regulator of all nutrients' metabolism both in prandial and fasting states. Insulin exerts its effects directly and indirectly on enzymes involved in the three main cellular function processes; metabolic, inflammation and repair, and cell growth and regeneration. Final regulators that control the enzymatic functions through stimulation or suppression of a cell are nuclear receptors in especially farnesoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor/RXR ligands, adiponectin, leptin, and adiponutrin. Insulin hormone has direct effect on these final modulators. Whereas blood glucose level, serum lipids, incretin hormones, bile acids in conjunction with microbiota are intermediary modulators which are controlled by lifestyle. The purpose of this review is to overview the key players in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) that help us understand the disease natural course, risk stratification, role of lifestyle and pharmacotherapy in each individual patient with MASLD to achieve personalized care and target the practice of precision medicine. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were used to identify publication related to metabolism of carbohydrate and fat in states of health and disease states; MASLD, cardiovascular disease and cancer. More than 1000 publications including original research and review papers were reviewed."

"Polyphenols, natural micronutrients derived from plants, are valued for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The escalating global prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) underscores its status as a chronic progressive liver condition. Furthermore, the dysregulation of gut microbiota (GM) is implicated in the onset and progression of NAFLD through the actions of metabolites such as bile acids (BAs), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), choline, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Additionally, GM may influence the integrity of the intestinal barrier. This review aims to evaluate the potential effects of polyphenols on GM and intestinal barrier function, and their subsequent impact on NAFLD. We searched through a wide range of databases, such as Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus to gather information for our non-systematic review of English literature. GM functions and composition can be regulated by polyphenols such as chlorogenic acid, curcumin, green tea catechins, naringenin, quercetin, resveratrol, and sulforaphane. Regulating GM composition improves NAFLD by alleviating inflammation, liver fat accumulation, and liver enzymes. Furthermore, it improves serum lipid profile and gut barrier integrity. All of these components affect NAFLD through the metabolites of GM, including SCFAs, choline, LPS, and BAs. Current evidence indicates that chlorogenic acid, resveratrol, quercetin, and curcumin can modulate GM, improving intestinal barrier integrity and positively impacting NAFLD. More studies are necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of naringenin, sulforaphane, and catechin."

"Diabetes, a complex multisystem metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, leads to complications that reduce quality of life and increase mortality. Diabetes pathophysiology includes dysfunction of beta cells, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from immune-mediated beta cell destruction. The more prevalent type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by varying degrees of beta cell dysfunction in concert with insulin resistance. The strong association between obesity and T2D involves pathways regulated by the central nervous system governing food intake and energy expenditure, integrating inputs from peripheral organs and the environment. The risk of developing diabetes or its complications represents interactions between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, including the availability of nutritious food and other social determinants of health. This perspective reviews recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of diabetes and its complications, which could alter the course of this prevalent disorder."
"Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have an increased risk of developing liver cancer and higher risk of death compared to non-Hispanic White individuals. The role of individual-level risk factors, social determinants of health, and barriers navigating health systems present unique challenges in obtaining liver cancer care for these patients. Additionally, the Asian American and Pacific Islander population is a heterogenous group originating from several different countries and speaking various languages, and they are often underrepresented in cancer clinical trial populations. This article describes the challenges faced by Asian American and Pacific Islander patients with liver cancer from the clinician, research, and patient advocacy perspectives and proposes targeted solutions to reduce healthcare disparities in this group."

"People living with HIV are particularly susceptible to developing metabolic disorders, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and other forms of SLD. However, people living with HIV have been historically excluded from clinical trials and large cohort studies of SLD. Therefore, our understanding of the risk factors and natural history of SLD in this population is poor. Moreover, relevant knowledge gaps on the epidemiology and barriers for adequate health care, such as stigma, hamper adequate responses to the ongoing HIV and SLD syndemic. This Viewpoint provides a comprehensive perspective on how to tackle SLD in people living with HIV by examining the role of social determinants of health in the development of liver disease and metabolic syndrome comorbidities among this population, emphasising the importance of prioritising SLD management, summarising the most urgent needs in the field, and offering recommendations for advancing research to fill key data gaps and protect liver health of people living with HIV."
"Spontaneous preterm delivery is defined as the beginning of the birth process before the 37th week of pregnancy. The presence of microorganisms in the fetal membranes is accompanied by an increase in the production of prostaglandin, one of the important factors associated with the prevalence of preterm birth. The invasion of microorganisms leads to the production of protease, coagulase, and elastase, which directly stimulate the onset of childbirth. We investigated the role of genital infections in women with preterm birth."

"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease globally, with an estimated prevalence exceeding 25%. Variants in the PNPLA3 and HSD17B13 genes have been a focus of investigations surrounding the etiology and progression of NAFLD and are believed to contribute to a greater burden of disease experienced by Hispanic Americans. However, little is known about socioeconomic factors influencing NAFLD progression or its increased prevalence among Hispanics."
"Solid organ transplantation (SOT) is considered the optimal treatment for children with end-stage organ failure; however, increased efforts are needed to understand the gap surrounding equitable access to and health outcomes of SOT for Indigenous children. This scoping review summarizes the literature on the characteristics of access to and health outcomes of pediatric SOT among Indigenous children in the settler-colonial states of Canada, Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. A search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for studies matching preestablished eligibility criteria from inception to November 2021. A preliminary gray literature search was also conducted. Twenty-four studies published between 1996 and 2021 were included. Studies addressed Indigenous pediatric populations within the United States (n = 7), Canada (n = 6), Aotearoa New Zealand (n = 5), Australia (n = 5), and Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia combined (n = 1). Findings showed that Indigenous children experienced longer time on dialysis, lower rates of preemptive and living donor kidney transplantation, and disparities in patient and graft outcomes after kidney transplantation. There were mixed findings about access to liver transplantation for Indigenous children and comparable findings for graft and patient outcomes after liver transplantation. Social determinants of health, such as geographic remoteness, lack of living donors, and traditional spiritual beliefs, may affect SOT access and outcomes for Indigenous children. Evidence gaps emphasize the need for action-based initiatives within SOT that prioritize research with and for Indigenous pediatric populations. Future research should include community-engaged methodologies, situated within local community contexts, to inform culturally safe care for Indigenous children."
"The impact of social determinants of health on adult liver transplant recipient outcomes is not clear at a national level. Further understanding of the impact of social determinants of health on patient outcomes can inform effective, equitable health care delivery. Unadjusted and multivariable models were used to analyze the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients to evaluate the association between the Social Deprivation Index (SDI) based on the liver transplant recipient's residential location and patient and graft survival. We included adult recipients between January 1, 2008 and December 1, 2021. Patient and graft survival were lower in adults living in areas with deprivation scores above the median. Five-year patient and graft survival were 78.7% and 76.5%, respectively, in the cohort above median SDI compared to 80.5% and 78.3% below median SDI. Compared to the recipients in low-deprivation residential areas, recipients residing in the highest deprivation (SDI quintile = 5) cohort had 6% higher adjusted risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.13) and 6% higher risk of graft failure (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.001-1.11). The increased risks for recipients residing in more vulnerable residential areas were higher (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.03-1.20 for both death and graft loss) following the first year after transplantation. Importantly, the overall risk for graft loss associated with SDI was not linear but instead accelerated above the median level of deprivation. In the United States, social determinants of health, as reflected by residential distress, significantly impacts 5-year patient and graft survival. The overall effect of residential deprivation modest, and importantly, results illustrate they are more strongly associated with longer-term follow-up and accelerate at higher deprivation levels. Further research is needed to evaluate effective interventions and policies to attenuate disparities in outcomes among recipients in highly disadvantaged areas."
"The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to study oral fungal carriage and its potential impact. In oral fungal environments, factors like changes in respiratory epithelium, increased pathogen attachment, local inflammation, and virulence factors could influence COVID-19 severity. The authors conducted a study to explore oral fungal carriage in COVID-19 patients and compare it to a healthy control group."
"Social determinants of health (SDoH) have been associated with disparate outcomes among those with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its risk factors. To address SDoH among this population, real-time SDoH screening in clinical settings is required, yet optimal screening methods are unclear. We performed a scoping review to describe the current literature on SDoH screening conducted in the clinical setting among individuals with MASLD and MASLD risk factors."
"Multimorbidity is prevalent among older adults and is associated with adverse health outcomes, including high emergency department (ED) utilization.

"Over the past few years, there has been a progressive increase in premature deaths attributable to suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol-related liver disease that impact life expectancy. Regarding the relationship with contextual effects, the evidence is developing, especially in countries with a peripheral economy, as is the case of Brazil. We carried out an analysis aimed at estimating the relationship between socioeconomic insecurity and deaths due to despair in Brazilian cities. We used 5,570 counties' data to create clusters concerning socioeconomic development and then analyzed age-adjusted mortality rates (ASMR) from each of them and compared them using the ANOVA test. Cluster analysis generated two groups of Brazilian municipalities. DoD rates are consistently higher in the group that experiences more deprivation. However, considering differences between 2010 and 2019, the increase in rates was higher in the group with less deprivation experience (48.82 % vs. 39.53 %) We verified an existing gap between the clusters before the beginning of economic stagnation in 2010 The gap between those two groups decreased from 20.58 % (p < 0.001) in 2010 to 14.03 % in 2019 (p = 0.034). The conjuncture of economic crises creates mortality differentials in certain population groups. Also, significant inequalities explain how causes of death from despair affect different subpopulations. Our first approach assessed this assumption, and we could check those differentials at an ecological level. Public policies should focus on reducing the difference in mortality from despair between higher and lower socioeconomic strata."
"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus is the most common risk factor for developing liver malignancy. Autophagy is an essential element in human cell maintenance. Several studies have demonstrated that autophagy plays a vital role in liver cancer at different stages. In this systematic review, we intend to investigate the role of polymorphism and mutations of autophagy-related genes (ATGs) in the pathogenesis and carcinogenesis of the hepatitis B virus (HBV)."
"Social determinants of health (SDOH) are important predictors of poor clinical outcomes in chronic diseases, but their associations among the general cirrhosis population and liver transplantation (LT) are limited. We conducted a retrospective, multiinstitutional analysis of adult (≥18-years-old) patients with cirrhosis in metropolitan Chicago to determine the associations of poor neighborhood-level SDOH on decompensation complications, mortality, and LT waitlisting. Area deprivation index and covariates extracted from the American Census Survey were aspects of SDOH that were investigated. Among 15 101 patients with cirrhosis, the mean age was 57.2 years; 6414 (42.5%) were women, 6589 (43.6%) were non-Hispanic White, 3652 (24.2%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 2662 (17.6%) were Hispanic. Each quintile increase in area deprivation was associated with poor outcomes in decompensation (sHR [subdistribution hazard ratio] 1.07; 95% CI 1.05-1.10; P < .001), waitlisting (sHR 0.72; 95% CI 0.67-0.76; P < .001), and all-cause mortality (sHR 1.09; 95% CI 1.06-1.12; P < .001). Domains of SDOH associated with a lower likelihood of waitlisting and survival included low income, low education, poor household conditions, and social support (P < .001). Overall, patients with cirrhosis residing in poor neighborhood-level SDOH had higher decompensation, and mortality, and were less likely to be waitlisted for LT. Further exploration of structural barriers toward LT or optimizing health outcomes is warranted."
"Most cancer deaths are related to gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Several environmental and genetic factors are effective in the occurrence of GI cancers, such as esophageal, stomach, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers. In addition to risk factors related to lifestyle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) also play a role in GI cancers, and an increase in the amount of free radicals can lead to oxidative stress and increase the probability of malignancies. NQO1 is part of the body's antioxidant defense system that protects cells against mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. NQO1 is responsible for reducing quinones to hydroquinone and preventing the generation of ROS by catalyzing the reaction. The existence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NADPH Quinone Reductase 1 (NQO1), such as 609C>T NQO1, leads to a decrease in NQO1 enzyme activity. Some NQO1 polymorphisms may increase the risk of gastrointestinal cancer. So, the C609T polymorphism in the NQO1 gene has been found to be effective in causing gastrointestinal cancers. On the other hand, it is very important to know the role of biomarkers in the prognosis and management of cancer treatment. Therefore, this study investigated the role of NQO1 as a biomarker in the management of gastrointestinal cancers (prevention, diagnosis and treatment)."
"Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is an emergency, necessitating prompt referral and management at an experienced liver transplant center. Social determinants of health (SDOH) drive healthcare disparities and can affect many aspects of disease presentation, access to care, and ultimately clinical outcomes. Potential associations between SDOH and PALF outcomes, including spontaneous recovery (SR), liver transplant (LT) or death, are unknown. This study aims to investigate how SDOH may affect PALF and therefore identify areas for intervention to mitigate unrecognized disparities."

"Given the increasing burden of liver cancer in Europe, it is crucial to investigate how social determinants of health (SDoH) affect liver cancer risk factors and access to care in order to improve health outcomes equitably. This paper summarises the available evidence on the differential distribution of liver cancer risk factors, incidence, and health outcomes in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from an SDoH perspective. Vulnerable and marginalised populations have low socio-economic and educational levels and are the most affected by liver cancer risk factors. Reasons for this include varied access to hepatitis B virus vaccination and limited access to viral hepatitis B and C screening, harm reduction, and treatment. Additionally, alcohol-related liver disease remains highly prevalent among individuals with low education, insecure employment, economic instability, migrants, and deprived populations. Moreover, significant variation exists across Europe in the proportion of adults with steatotic liver disease, overweight/obesity, and diabetes, based on geographical area, gender, socio-economic and educational background, and density of ultra-processed food outlets. Inequities in cirrhosis mortality rates have been reported, with the highest death rates among individuals living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas and those with lower educational levels. Furthermore, insufficient healthcare access for key populations with primary liver cancer is influenced by complex healthcare systems, stigmatisation, discrimination, low education, language barriers, and fear of disclosure. These challenges contribute to inequities in liver cancer care pathways. Future studies are needed to explore the different SDoH-interlinked effects on liver cancer incidence and outcomes in European countries. The ultimate goal is to develop evidence-based multilevel public health interventions that reduce the SDoH impact in precipitating and perpetuating the disproportionate burden of liver cancer in specific populations."

Other notable features of the document are its emphasis on self-management education, therapeutic behaviour, sleep hygiene, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and weight loss. Focus on individualization of care, social determinants of health, and ethnic variations are pertinent from an Afro-Asian perspective. The ""language matters"" section is a welcome addition that will help to overcome several barriers in diabetes care."
"β-Thalassemia patients may have cardiac complications due to iron overload, which puts them at higher risk of cardiac complications induced by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared with the normal population.

"Social determinants of health are important in designing effective interventions for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This systematic review characterises equity-oriented, social determinants of health-focused HBV interventions, and describes their effectiveness in terms of the prevention, care, or treatment of HBV in high-income countries. We searched electronic databases for central concepts of 'HBV', 'equity', 'social determinants of health', 'intervention', and 'Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries'. Screening and data abstraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. Data were abstracted from 66 studies; articles with a comparative study design (n=36) were included in the narrative synthesis, highlighting social determinants of health domains of interventions, HBV-relevant health outcomes, and extra-health social determinants of health effects (ie, those effects that extend beyond health outcomes). Synthesis aligned with six emergent themes corresponding to HBV prevention and care: knowledge and education, diagnosis and screening, immunisation, care initiation, engagement with clinical care and treatment, and upstream prevention. Studies presented a heterogeneous array of HBV-relevant health outcomes. Most interventions were tailored for social determinants of health domains of race, ethnicity, culture, and language; drug use; and socioeconomic status. Across the themes, at least two-thirds of interventions showed comparative effectiveness for addressing HBV. Extra-health social determinants of health outcomes were observed for two studies. Considerable diversity in population-level approaches was observed regarding intervention goals and effectiveness; most interventions were effective at enhancing the prevention, care, or treatment of HBV."
"While the vaccination was introduced as a promising tool to control the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, concerns about vaccine-related side effects had grown. Due to the widespread administration of the COVID-19 vaccine worldwide for the first time, it was necessary to evaluate the safety and potential side effects in recipients. This study aims to assess, the incidence of adverse effects following Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccination and identify their related factors. In this cross-sectional survey-based study, 453 volunteers participated, including 235 men and 218 women. The reported adverse reactions from recipients of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine were collected by using a questionnaire. The findings showed that the incidence of adverse reactions, such as neurological, systematic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and local symptoms were significantly higher after the first dose compared to the second dose. Systematic symptoms were the most prevalent reported side effects after the first and second dose injection. The demographical study of participants showed that individuals aged 18-34 and females were more prone to present adverse events following vaccination. However, no significant relationship was found between the occurrence of side effects and the recipients' body mass index. Despite the life-saving role of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, it may have some adverse reactions in recipients. The severity and frequency of side effects were different. So, they were dependent on several factors, including gender and age. Altogether, post-vaccination adverse reactions were mild and tolerable."

"Frailty is a state of increased vulnerability from physical, social, and cognitive factors resulting in greater risk of negative health-related outcomes and increased healthcare expenditure. A 36-factor electronic frailty index (eFI) developed in the United Kingdom calculates frailty scores using electronic medical record data. There is currently no standardization of frailty screening in Canadian primary care. In order to implement the eFI in a Canadian context, adaptation of the tool is necessary because frailty is represented by different clinical terminologies in the UK and Canada. In considering the promise of implementing an eFI in British Columbia, Canada, we first looked at the content validation of the 36-factor eFI. Our research question was: Does the eFI represent frailty from the perspectives of primary care clinicians and older adults in British Columbia?"
"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a systemic disorder with a complex multifactorial and heterogeneous pathogenesis and has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in many countries around the world. Numerous studies in Iran have presented different results on the prevalence and risk factors of NAFLD, in this study, which has been done in a systematic review and meta-analysis, provides a good estimate of the prevalence and risk factors of the disease in Iran. Following the peer review of electronic search strategies (PRESS and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses [PRISMA] statement, we searched Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Persian scientific searcher (Elmnet) from inception to September 19, 2022. In the present study, 71 articles were reviewed for qualitative and meta-analysis. The overall mean prevalence of NAFLD in children studies was 22.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.9% to 33.9%). The prevalence was notably higher in adult studies 40.5% (95% CI: 35.1% to 46%). In 24 studies, the association between NAFLD and sex was reported, 10 of which showed significant relationships. Out of 46 studies observed that NAFLD prevalence increased significantly with body mass index (BMI). Eight out of 14 studies reported significant associations between FBS and NAFLD in children's studies. Though Iran has a high NAFLD prevalence compared to most areas, and due to the unfavorable situation of risk factors contributing to the NAFLD, it is necessary to take the necessary interventions to control these risk factors and prevent NAFLD."
"The objective of this study is to investigate the correlation between the neighborhood deprivation index and survival rates of cancer patients in Korea. In this study, 5-year age-standardized survival rates of patients with cancer were determined using the National Cancer Cohort from 2014 to 2018 in Korea. The primary cancer sites were the stomach, colorectum, liver, lung, breast, cervix, prostate, and thyroid. Disparities were measured, and their impact on the overall survival rates was assessed using the Korean version of the Neighborhood Deprivation Index. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the strength of the correlation. The study cohort comprised 726,665 patients with cancer, of whom 50.7% were male. The predominant primary cancer sites were the stomach ("
"Disparities exist in the access to living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in the United States. However, the association of neighborhood-level social determinants of health (SDoH) on the receipt of LDLT is not well-established. This was a retrospective cohort study of adult liver transplant recipients between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2021 at centers performing LDLT using the United Network for Organ Sharing database, which was linked through patients' ZIP code to a set of 24 neighborhood-level SDoH measures from different data sources. Temporal trends and center differences in neighborhood Social Deprivation Index (SDI), a validated scale of socioeconomic deprivation ranging from 0 to 100 (0=least disadvantaged), were assessed by transplant type. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated the association of increasing SDI on receipt of LDLT [vs. deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT)]. There were 51,721 DDLT and 4026 LDLT recipients at 59 LDLT-performing centers during the study period. Of the 24 neighborhood-level SDoH measures studied, the SDI was most different between the 2 transplant types, with LDLT recipients having lower SDI (ie, less socioeconomic disadvantage) than DDLT recipients (median SDI 37 vs. 47; p < 0.001). The median difference in SDI between the LDLT and DDLT groups significantly decreased from 13 in 2005 to 3 in 2021 ( p = 0.003). In the final model, the SDI quintile was independently associated with transplant type ( p < 0.001) with a threshold SDI of ~40, above which increasing SDI was significantly associated with reduced odds of LDLT (vs. reference SDI 1-20). As a neighborhood-level SDoH measure, SDI is useful for evaluating disparities in the context of LDLT. Center outreach efforts that aim to reduce disparities in LDLT could preferentially target US ZIP codes with SDI > 40."

"Safety-net hospitals (SNHs) and facilities are the cornerstone of healthcare services for the medically underserved. The burden of chronic liver disease-including end-stage manifestations of cirrhosis and liver cancer-is high and rising among populations living in poverty who primarily seek and receive care in safety-net settings. For many reasons related to social determinants of health, these individuals often present with delayed diagnoses and disease presentations, resulting in higher liver-related mortality. With recent state-based policy changes such as Medicaid expansion that impact access to insurance and critical health services, an overview of the body of literature on SNH care for chronic liver disease is timely and informative for the liver disease community. In this narrative review, we discuss controversies in the definition of a SNH and summarize the known disparities in the cascade of the care and management of common liver-related conditions: (1) steatotic liver disease, (2) liver cancer, (3) chronic viral hepatitis, and (4) cirrhosis and liver transplantation. In addition, we review the specific impact of Medicaid expansion on safety-net systems and liver disease outcomes and highlight effective provider- and system-level interventions. Lastly, we address remaining gaps and challenges to optimizing care for vulnerable populations with chronic liver disease in safety-net settings."
"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare type of autoimmune hepatic disease with unknown pathophysiology, often a sequela of ulcerative colitis (UC). Liver transplant, though curative, is inaccessible to many patients due to stringent organ availability and barriers to sufficient insurance coverage. Low health literacy and low socioeconomic class can significantly limit healthcare access and thus worsen overall healthcare outcomes. Here, we present the case of an uninsured 49-year-old man with untreated UC who was diagnosed with PSC and subsequently became lost to follow-up. It is critical for providers to identify barriers to acquiring appropriate medical care, such as financial instability and low health literacy, when identifying and treating conditions like PSC. Moreover, more research should be performed to investigate alternative treatments for PSC."
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) disproportionately impacts racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. These social determinants of health (SDH) lead to disparities in access to care and outcomes. We aim to understand the relationship between SDH and survival and locoregional treatment options in HCC.
"The social determinants of health contribute to adverse post-liver transplant outcomes. Identifying unmet social risks may enable transplant teams to improve long-term outcomes for at-risk children. However, providers may feel uncomfortable asking about household-level social risks in the posttransplant period because they might make their patients/families uncomfortable."
"Social determinants of health and associated systems, policies, and practices are important drivers of health disparities. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations in the United States have elevated incidence rates of stomach, liver, and colorectal cancers compared with other racial/ethnic groups. In this study, we examined incidence rates of 3 types of gastrointestinal cancer among non-Hispanic AI/AN (NH-AI/AN) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) populations by geographic region and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) score. Incident cases diagnosed during 2010-2019 were identified from population-based cancer registries linked with the Indian Health Service patient registration databases. Age-adjusted incidence rates (per 100,000 population) for stomach, liver, and colorectal cancers were compared within NH-AI/AN populations and between the NH-AI/AN and NHW populations by SVI score. Rates were higher among NH-AI/AN populations in moderate- and high-SVI-score counties in Alaska, the Southern Plains, and the East than in low-SVI counties. Incidence rates among NH-AI/AN populations were elevated when compared with NHW populations by SVI category. Results indicated that higher social vulnerability may drive elevated cancer incidence among NH-AI/AN populations. Additionally, disparities between NH-AI/AN and NHW populations persist even when accounting for SVI. Exploring social vulnerability can aid in designing more effective interventions to address root causes of cancer disparities among AI/AN populations."
"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is widespread worldwide. On the other hand, social inequality and socioeconomic status (SES) can affect all aspects of health. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between SES indicators and NAFLD."

"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent chronic liver disease with a global prevalence, and modulation of ANGPTL8 expression has emerged as a promising predictor of NAFLD susceptibility. This research was conducted to scrutinize ANGPTL8 protein expression in NAFLD patients and elucidate the interplay between ANGPTL8 gene polymorphisms and their lipid profiles, thus shedding new light on the pathophysiology of this complex disease. The study comprised 423 unrelated participants, including 222 healthy controls and 201 individuals with NAFLD, screened using FibroScan/ultrasonography and laboratory tests. The main goal focused on the genotype and allele frequency distribution in the ANGPTL8 gene, specifically analyzing two genetic variations: rs737337 (T/C) and rs2278426 (C/T). The participants diagnosed with NAFLD were slightly younger (P ≥ 0.05) and had a higher body mass index (BMI) than the individuals in the control group. Notably, there was a significant difference in the occurrence of the rs737337 polymorphism between the NAFLD and control groups, with a lower frequency observed in the NAFLD group. Our results indicated that individuals with the TC + CC genotype and C allele of rs737337 (T/C) had a decreased risk of higher levels of ALT and AST. Conversely, those with the CT, CT + TT genotype, and T allele of rs2278426 (C/T) exhibited an increased risk of higher levels of ALT and AST. The results imply that the rs2278426 (C/T) variant of the ANGPTL8 gene is more strongly linked to an increased risk of NAFLD compared to the rs737337 polymorphism. However, additional research is needed to understand the specific molecular mechanisms responsible for the upregulation of ANGPTL8 in individuals with NAFLD."

In this research, we aimed to investigate the time trends and identify the spatial clusters of incidence and mortality on a global scale over the last 30 years, using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019 data."
"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the most common cause of death worldwide and has become a public health concern. The proven notable risk factors for CVD are atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and some genetic defects. However, research has shown a correlation between metabolic health, gut microbiota, and dietary risk factors. The gut microbiota makes an important contribution to human functional metabolic pathways by contributing enzymes that are not encoded by the human genome, for instance, the breakdown of polysaccharides, polyphenols and vitamins synthesis. TMAO and SCFAs, human gut microbiota compounds, have respective immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory effects. Choline and l-carnitine are abundant in high-fat diets and are transformed into TMA by gut bacteria. The liver's phase of metabolism then changes TMA into TMAO. In turn, TMAO promotes the activation of macrophages, damages vascular endothelium, and results in CVD-however, dysbiosis decreases SCFAs and bile acids, which raises intestinal permeability. Congestion in the portal vein, a drop in cardiac output, a reduction in intestinal perfusion, and intestinal leakage are all caused by heart failure. These factors induce systemic inflammation by increasing intestinal leakage. By raising CRP and pro-inflammatory reactions, human gut dysbiosis and elevated TMAO levels promote the development of arterial plaque, hasten the beginning of atherosclerosis, and raise the risk of CAD. A healthy symbiosis between the gut microbiota and host is a key factor in shaping the biochemical profile of the diet, therefore which are crucial for maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier, growing mucosa, reducing inflammation, and controlling blood pressure."

"HCC, the most common form of primary liver cancer, is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related death in the United States. HCC disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. A practical framework is needed to organize the complex patient, provider, health system, and societal factors that drive these racial and ethnic disparities. In this narrative review, we adapted and applied the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) Research Framework to the HCC care continuum, as a step toward better understanding and addressing existing HCC-related disparities. We first summarize the literature on HCC-related disparities by race and ethnicity organized by the framework's 5 domains (biological, behavioral, physical/built environment, sociocultural environment, and health care system) and 4 levels (individual, interpersonal, community, and societal) of influence. We then offer strategies to guide future research initiatives toward promotion of health equity in HCC care. Clinicians and researchers may help mitigate further inequities and better address racial and ethnic disparities in HCC care by prioritizing the following in HCC research: (1) increasing racial and ethnic minority representation, (2) collecting and reporting HCC-related data by racial and ethnic subgroups, (3) assessing the patient experience of HCC care by race and ethnicity, and (4) evaluating HCC-specific social determinants of health by race and ethnicity. These 4 priorities will help inform the development of future programs and interventions that are tailored to the unique experiences of each racial and ethnic group."
"This study aimed to investigate the risk of gastric cancer (GC) in abnormal body mass index (BMI) groups. A systematic search was carried out on Embase, PubMed/Medline, and Scopus from January 2000 to January 2023. The pooled risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was assessed using a random-effect model. Thirteen studies with total of 14,020,031 participants were included in this systematic review. The pooled RR of GC was 1.124 (95% CI, 0.968-1.304, I"
"Lifestyle changes, prominently low mobility in recent years, have increased the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS), and cardiovascular disease risk. This study aimed to determine the relationship between physical activity and MetS using modern statistical methods in a population-based study."
"As policies governing liver transplantation (LT) continue to change and influence clinical practice, it is important to monitor trends in equitable access and outcomes amongst patients. The purpose of this review is to closely examine recent advances and findings in health equity research in LT over the last 2 years; specifically evaluating inequities at the different stages of LT (referral, evaluation, listing, waitlist outcomes and post-LT outcomes)."
"Ovarian cancer is amongst one of the most commonly occurring cancers affecting women, and the leading cause of gynecologic related cancer death. Its poor prognosis and high mortality rates can be attributed to the absence of specific signs and symptoms until advance stages, which frequently leads to late diagnosis. Survival rate of patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer can be used in order to better assess current standard of care; the aim of this study is to evaluate the survival rate of ovarian cancer patients in Asia."
"Oxidative stress has been considered the main contributor to liver injury. Dietary antioxidants would be expected to improve liver function. The hepatoprotective effects of antioxidants are controversial. In the present study, the associations of some dietary antioxidants and the levels of serum liver enzymes were examined. This cross-sectional study was conducted using the Rafsanjan Cohort Study (RCS) data as a population-based prospective cohort which is a part of the Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN (PERSIAN). A total of 9942 participants aged 35-70 years old were included in this study. Among this population, 4631 (46.59%) were male, and 5311 (53.42%) were female. Dietary intakes were collected by a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with 128 items. Aspartate transaminase (AST), Alanine transaminase (ALT), γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured by a biotecnica analyzer. Dichotomous logistics regression models were used to investigate the association between the elevated liver enzymes and intake of dietary antioxidants using crude and adjusted models. In the adjusted model, in subjects with higher consumption of Se, Vit A, Vit E, β-carotene, α-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin, the odds ratios of elevated ALP were decreased compared to the reference group (ORs 0.79 (0.64-0.96), 0.80 (0.66-0.98), 0.73 (0.60-0.89), 0.79 (0.64-0.96), 0.78 (0.64-0.95), 0.80 (0.66-0.98), and 0.79 (0.64-0.98), respectively). Subjects with higher consumption of Se, Vit A, Vit E, and provitamin A carotenoids (β-carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin) showed decreased odds of elevated ALP. These findings support the hypothesis that Se, Vit A, Vit E, and provitamin A carotenoids may be associated with improvements in ALP and act as suppressors against the development of liver injury."
"This study aimed to evaluate the hepatotoxicity of buprenorphine in lactating rat pups of buprenorphine-injected mothers. Buprenorphine (BUP), a semisynthetic opioid, is increasingly administrated as a first-line standard maintenance treatment for opioid dependence due to its high safety and efficacy compared to other opioids. Numerous studies have confirmed the safety of BUP maintenance treatment in addicted patients."

"Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currently the recommended procedure for axillary staging in clinically node-negative early breast cancer at diagnosis. The present study aimed to identify Cytokeratin-19 (CK19) gene profiles that accurately predicted the outcome of breast cancer patients. Fifty tumor samples from breast cancer patients were analyzed for the expression of the CK19 gene using quantitative PCR. Also, normal breast tissues (N = 50) were taken from the same patients that had undergone partial or total mastectomy. This gene signature was confirmed based on tumor's stage, grade, and estrogen receptor (ER) status, using conditional logistic regression. Based on these findings, the negative reported lymph nodes for metastasis had micrometastasis in significant values. There was a significant difference between normal and cancer samples in  CK19 expression. In this sentinel node evaluation, the relationship of this gene with tumor characteristics needs to be established and discussed finding a clear role for this gene in tumor outcome."
The reasons for the geographic disparities in liver-related mortality across the US remain ill-defined. We sought to investigate the impact of travel distance to liver transplantation (LT) programs and social vulnerability on county differences in liver-related mortality.
"Overlap syndrome (OS) is a term that comprises the presentation of multiple hepatic disease characteristics in the same patient, such as the presence of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) features in addition to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Standard therapy for AIH is immunosuppression, while ursodeoxycholic acid is the preferred treatment for PBC. Additionally, liver transplantation (LT) may be considered in severe cases. Hispanics have been found to have a higher prevalence of chronic liver disease and develop more complications associated with portal hypertension at the time of listing for LT. Despite being the fastest-growing population in the USA, Hispanics have a higher probability of not receiving an LT due to issues with social determinants of health (SDOH). It has been reported that Hispanics are more likely to be removed from the transplant list. We report a case of a 25-year-old female immigrant from a Latin American developing country who presented with symptoms consistent with worsening liver disease after years of inappropriate workup and late diagnosis due to barriers within the healthcare system. The patient had a history of unresolved jaundice and pruritus and presented with worsening of her previous symptoms and new onset abdominal distention, bilateral leg edema, and telangiectasias. Laboratory and imaging studies confirmed the diagnosis of AIH and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC-AIH syndrome). The patient was started on steroids, azathioprine, and ursodeoxycholic acid, showing improvement. Due to her migratory status, she could not receive an appropriate diagnosis and follow up with a single provider or healthcare institution, putting her at increased risk for life-threatening complications. Although medical management is the first step, the probability of future liver transplants exists. The patient is still undergoing liver transplant evaluation and completing a workup since she was found to have an elevated model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Even with the introduction of new scores and policies that aim to reduce disparities in LT, Hispanic patients are still at higher risk of being removed from the waitlist because of death or clinical deterioration compared to non-Hispanics. To this day, Hispanics have the highest percentage of waitlist deaths (20.8%) of all ethnicities and the lowest overall rate for undergoing LT. Understanding and addressing the causes that could contribute to and explain this phenomenon is essential. Increasing awareness of this problem is vital to promote more research on LT disparities."
"As regards colorectal cancer (CRC) in France, social inequalities in health (SIH) exist. Underprivileged patients are characterized by reduced incidence of CRC and, conversely, by excess mortality. The explanatory mechanisms of the SIHs influencing survival are complex, multidimensional and variable according to healthcare system. Among the most deprived compared to the least deprived patients, SIHs are reflected by lower participation in screening campaigns, and CRC diagnosis is more frequently given at a later stage in an emergency context. During treatment, disadvantaged patients are more at risk of having to undergo open surgery and of enduring severe postoperative complications and belated chemotherapy (when recommended). Study of SIHs poses unusual challenges, as it is necessary not only to pinpoint social deprivation, but also to locate the different treatment facilities existing in a given territorial expanse. In the absence of individualized socioeconomic information, research in France on the social determinants of health is based on duly constituted cancer registries, in which an ecological index of social deprivation, the European Deprivation Index (EDI), provides an aggregate measure of the socioeconomic environment of a given individual in a given geographical setting at a given point in time. All in all, studies on SIHs are justified as means of identification and comprehension of the mechanisms underlying social deprivation, the objective being to more precisely orient programs and practices aimed at combating SIH."
"There are well-described racial and ethnic disparities in the burden of chronic liver diseases. Hispanic persons are at highest risk for developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the fastest growing cause of liver disease. Hepatitis B disproportionately affects persons of Asian or African descent. The highest rates of hepatitis C occur in American Indian and Alaskan Native populations. In addition to disparities in disease burden, there are also marked racial and ethnic disparities in access to treatments, including liver transplantation. Disparities also exist by gender and geography, especially in alcohol-related liver disease. To achieve health equity, we must address the root causes that drive these inequities. Understanding the role that social determinants of health play in the disparate health outcomes that are currently observed is critically important. We must forge and/or strengthen collaborations between patients, community members, other key stakeholders, health care providers, health care institutions, professional societies, and legislative bodies. Herein, we provide a high-level review of current disparities in chronic liver disease and describe actionable strategies that have potential to bridge gaps, improve quality, and promote equity in liver care."
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly prevalent in Asians and Pacific Islanders (API) but this heterogenous group is often aggregated into a single category, despite vast differences in culture, socioeconomic status, education, and access to care among subgroups. There remains a significant knowledge gap in HCC outcomes among different subgroups of API. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was accessed, and site/ICD codes were used to identify HCC patients during 2010-2019 who were API ethnicity. Data collected: demographics, socioeconomic status, tumor characteristics, treatment, and survival. Subgroup analyses were performed among different Asian ethnicities in a secondary analysis. 8,249 patients were identified/subdivided into subgroups of Asian ethnicities and Other Pacific Islanders (NHOPI) groups. The median age was 65 years for Asians and 62 years for NHOPI (p < 0.01), and significant differences were found in income (p < 0.01). A higher proportion of NHOPI lived in rural areas compared to Asians (8.1 vs. 1.1%, p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences in tumor size, stage, pre-treatment AFP level, or surgical treatments between the two groups. However, Asians had higher overall median survival than NHOPI (20 months v 12 months, p < 0.01). Secondary analyses among different subgroups of Asian ethnicities revealed significant differences in tumor size and staging, surgical resection, transplant rates, and median survival. While API had similar tumor characteristics and treatment, Asians had much higher survival than NHOPI. Socioeconomic differences and access to care may contribute to these differences. This study also found significant survival disparities within API ethnicities."
"Hepatitis B is a chronic condition, primarily associated with hepatitis B viral infection in early life. The failure of prevention and appropriate management can lead to subsequent liver cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis B most commonly affects people born in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa and their global diasporas. The physical, psychological, and social impacts of hepatitis B are strongly influenced by sex and gender. Inequities in access to timely, sensitive diagnosis and effective management arise from interactions between structural inequalities related to race, ethnicity, Indigenous/settler status, class, and geography. The biomedical response to hepatitis B has led to advances in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, but many affected communities have explanatory health belief models that differ from that of biomedicine. We argue that an intersectional approach, led by affected people and communities, can integrate biomedicine with the lived experience and social context that give purpose to and shape all personal, communal, clinical, and public health responses to hepatitis B. This approach has the potential to enable a consciously equitable, effective response to the biopsychosocial complexities of hepatitis B, improve the health and wellbeing of people living with hepatitis B, and reduce hepatitis B-associated mortality."
"Disparities exist in referral and access to the liver transplant (LT) waitlist, and social determinants of health (SDOH) are increasingly recognized as important factors driving health inequities, including in LT. The SDOH of potential transplant candidates is therefore important to characterize when designing targeted interventions to promote equity in access to LT. Yet, it is uncertain how a transplant center should approach this issue, characterize SDOH, identify disparities, and use these data to inform interventions. We performed a retrospective study of referrals for first-time, single-organ LT to our center from 2016 to 2020. Addresses were geoprocessed and mapped to the corresponding county, census tract, and census block group to assess their geospatial distribution, identify potential disparities in referrals, and characterize their communities across multiple domains of SDOH to identify potential barriers to evaluation and selection. We identified variability in referral patterns and areas with disproportionately low referrals, including counties in the highest quartile of liver disease mortality (9%) and neighborhoods in the highest quintile of socioeconomic deprivation (17%) and quartile of poverty (21%). Black individuals were also under-represented compared with expected state demographics (12% vs. 18%). Among the referral population, several potential barriers to evaluation and selection for LT were identified, including poverty, educational attainment, access to healthy food, and access to technology. This approach to the characterization of a transplant center's referral population by geographic location and associated SDOH demonstrates a model for identifying disparities in a referral population and potential barriers to evaluation that can be used to inform targeted interventions for disparities in LT access."
Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases. It is estimated that more than 400 million people will suffer from it by 2025.

"In the USA, deaths due to suicide, alcohol, or drug-related causes (e.g., alcohol-related liver disease, overdose) have doubled since 2002. Veterans appear disproportionately impacted by growing trends. Limited research has been conducted regarding the relationship between community-level factors (e.g., rurality, community distress resulting from economic conditions) and the presence of spatial clustering of suicide, alcohol-related, or drug-related deaths. We explored community-level relationships in Colorado Veterans and compared suicide, alcohol-, and drug-related death rates between the Colorado adult population and Veterans."

The management of invasive infections related to substance use disorder (SUD) needing parenteral antimicrobial therapy is challenging and may have poor treatment outcomes including nonadherence and lack of completion of parenteral antimicrobial therapy.
"Our investigation aimed at evaluating the relationship between metabolic syndrome, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the Rafsanjan cohort study (RCS). We used data obtained from the RCS, as a part of the prospective epidemiological research studies in Iran. In this cross-sectional research, 9895 participants from the baseline phase of RCS who completed medical questionnaire were included. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) defined using NCEP-ATP III criteria. The relationship between elevated serum liver enzymes levels even within the normal range and metabolic syndrome was evaluated by logistic regressions. The prevalence of MetS was 34.42% in the participants of study. The mean concentrations of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT increased with increasing MetS components. After adjusting for all potential confounders, elevated serum concentrations of ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP even within the normal range were related with an increased odds of MetS. MetS was associated with increased levels of liver enzymes even within the normal range. These results indicated the potential for elevated liver enzymes as biomarkers for the possible presence of MetS."

"Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is still among the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and the world is not on track to meet targets set for ending the epidemic by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Precise HIV burden information is critical for effective geographic and epidemiological targeting of prevention and treatment interventions. Age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence estimates are widely available at the national level, and region-wide local estimates were recently published for adults overall. We add further dimensionality to previous analyses by estimating HIV prevalence at local scales, stratified into sex-specific 5-year age groups for adults ages 15-59 years across SSA."
"One of the principles of Persian medicine (PM) is the individualized approach that is presented with the concept of Mizaj. In this viewpoint, on the whole body, Mizaj is determined for every person based on 10 criteria, which is a result of the Mizaj of the main organs, including the brain, liver, and heart. There is no standard diagnostic tool for Mizaj assessment yet. The purpose of this study is to explain the method of Mizaj assessment and data analysis in the elderly in one of the biggest health and aging projects in Iran. The second phase of the Amirkola health and aging project (AHAP) evaluated more than 1,700 clinical and laboratory examinations of 2135 elderly people."

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and excessive alcohol consumption are leading causes of liver disease worldwide. Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) are well-tolerated treatments for HCV infections with high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates. There are limited data assessing the influence of alcohol use on DAA uptake and cure.
"As the incidence of deaths from external causes including poisonings, suicide, and alcohol-related liver disease, increases in countries such as the United States and Canada, a better understanding of the fundamental social determinants of the substance use underlying these so-called ""deaths of despair"", at the population level, is needed. Using data from the nationally representative data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2003, 2015-2016, 2018 cycles) (N = 30,729), the independent associations between age, sex, marital status, immigrant status, race/ethnicity, education, income, rurality, affective health and the use of illicit substances, opioids (without distinction for prescription status), problematic levels of alcohol, and combined past-year use (≥2) of substances, were explored using multivariate logistic regression, marginal risk, and population attributable fraction estimation, with propensity score-adjusted sensitivity analyses. Males, those who were under 29 years, without a partner, born in Canada, White, or had an affective disorder reported both higher use of individual substances and multiple substances in the past year. Social determinants appear to explain a substantial proportion of substance use patterns overall. Between 10% and 45% of illicit substance, problematic alcohol, and polysubstance use prevalence was attributable to non-partnered marital status, non-immigrant status, and White race/ethnicity. Of opioid use prevalence, 25% was attributable to White race/ethnicity, 13% to affective disorder status and 4% to lower-income. Though not all substance use will result in substance-related morbidity or mortality, these findings highlight the role of social determinants in shaping the intermediary behavioural outcomes that shape population-level risk of ""deaths of despair""."
We sought to determine the impact of social determinants of health (SDoH) on outcomes of patients undergoing resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
"Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathology of thyroid disorders. This study examined the effect of gallic acid (GA) on the oxidative status and expression of liver antioxidant genes including thioredoxin (TXN1 & TXN2) and thioredoxin reductase1 (TXNRd1) in hypo- and hyperthyroid rat models. Forty-nine male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into seven groups as follows: control group, hypothyroid and hyperthyroid groups respectively induced by propylthiouracil and levothyroxine, hypo- and hyper thyroid-treated groups (where the groups were separately treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg of GA daily, orally). The levels of thyroid hormones and serum oxidative stress markers were evaluated after 5 weeks. The relative expression of TXN1,2 and TXNRd1 genes was measured via real-time qRT-PCR. The mean level of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde, and uric acid index diminished in the hypothyroid group. Increased TAC reached almost the level of control in hypothyroid groups treated with GA. Elevation of thiol index in the hypothyroid group was observed ("

"More than 3 billion people do not have access to clean energy and primarily use solid fuels to cook. Use of solid fuels generates household air pollution, which was associated with more than 2 million deaths in 2019. Although local patterns in cooking vary systematically, subnational trends in use of solid fuels have yet to be comprehensively analysed. We estimated the prevalence of solid-fuel use with high spatial resolution to explore subnational inequalities, assess local progress, and assess the effects on health in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) without universal access to clean fuels."

"Opium use was recently classified as a human carcinogen for lung cancer by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. We conducted a large, multicenter case-control study evaluating the association between opium use and the risk of lung cancer. We recruited 627 cases and 3477 controls from May 2017 to July 2020. We used unconditional logistic regression analyses to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and measured the association between opium use and the risk of lung cancer. The ORs were adjusted for the residential place, age, gender, socioeconomic status, cigarettes, and water pipe smoking. We found a 3.6-fold risk of lung cancer for regular opium users compared to never users (95% CI: 2.9, 4.6). There was a strong dose-response association between a cumulative count of opium use and lung cancer risk. The OR for regular opium use was higher for small cell carcinoma than in other histology (8.3, 95% CI: 4.8, 14.4). The OR of developing lung cancer among opium users was higher in females (7.4, 95% CI: 3.8, 14.5) than in males (3.3, 95% CI: 2.6, 4.2). The OR for users of both opium and tobacco was 13.4 (95% CI: 10.2, 17.7) compared to nonusers of anything. The risk of developing lung cancer is higher in regular opium users, and these results strengthen the conclusions on the carcinogenicity of opium. The association is stronger for small cell carcinoma cases than in other histology."
"Bone indexes including trabecular bone score (TBS) and bone mineral density (BMD) have been shown to be associated with wide spectrum of variables including physical activity, vitamin D, liver enzymes, biochemical measurements, mental and sleep disorders, and quality of life.

"The syndemic of hazardous alcohol consumption, opioid use, and obesity has led to important changes in liver disease epidemiology that have exacerbated health disparities. Health disparities occur when plausibly avoidable health differences are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations. Highlighting health disparities, their sources, and consequences in chronic liver disease is fundamental to improving liver health outcomes. There have been large increases in alcohol use disorder in women, racial and ethnic minorities, and those experiencing poverty in the context of poor access to alcohol treatment, leading to increasing rates of alcohol-associated liver diseases. Rising rates of NAFLD and associated fibrosis have been observed in Hispanic persons, women aged > 50, and individuals experiencing food insecurity. Access to viral hepatitis screening and linkage to treatment are suboptimal for racial and ethnic minorities and individuals who are uninsured or underinsured, resulting in greater liver-related mortality and later-stage diagnoses of HCC. Data from more diverse cohorts on autoimmune and cholestatic liver diseases are lacking, supporting the need to study the contemporary epidemiology of these disorders in greater detail. Herein, we review the existing literature on racial and ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic disparities in chronic liver diseases using a social determinants of health framework to better understand how social and structural factors cause health disparities and affect chronic liver disease outcomes. We also propose potential solutions to eliminate disparities, outlining health-policy, health-system, community, and individual solutions to promote equity and improve health outcomes."
"Digital health interventions have become increasingly common across health care, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health inequalities, particularly with respect to ethnicity, may not be considered in frameworks that address the implementation of digital health interventions. We considered frameworks to include any models, theories, or taxonomies that describe or predict implementation, uptake, and use of digital health interventions."
"Background Liver transplantation is the life-saving standard of care for those with end-stage liver disease. Unfortunately, many patients on the liver transplant list die waiting. Several studies have demonstrated significant differences based on disparities in race, gender, and multiple socioeconomic factors. We sought to evaluate recent disparities among patients receiving liver transplants using the latest available data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), the largest publicly available inpatient care database in the United States. Methods We performed an analysis of discharge data from the NIS between 2016 and 2019. We identified adult patients with chronic liver disease who underwent a liver transplant using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for differences in race, gender, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities among those who received a liver transplant. Results A total of 24,595 liver transplants were performed over the study period. Female gender was independently associated with decreased transplant rates (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78-0.89, P < 0.001). Compared to White patients, Black patients had decreased transplant rates (AOR 0.86, 95% CI, 0.75-0.99, P = 0.034), as did Native Americans (AOR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.97, P = 0.035). Hispanics and Asian Americans had increased rates of liver transplantation (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.32, P = 0.022, and 1.36, 95% CI 1.11-1.67, P = 0.003; respectively). The increase in income quartile was associated with an incremental increase in transplant rates. Additionally, patients with private insurance had much higher transplant rates compared to those with Medicare (AOR 2.50, 95% CI 2.31-2.70, P < 0.001) while patients without insurance had the lowest rates of transplantation (AOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12-0.28, P < 0.001). Conclusions Our analysis demonstrates that race, gender, and other social determinants of health have significant impacts on the likelihood of receiving a liver transplant. Our study, on a national level, confirms previously described disparities in receiving liver transplantation. Patient-level studies are needed to better understand how these variables translate into differing liver transplantation rates."

"We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the role of serum levels of CA125 and HE4 in predicting optimal cytoreductive surgery. Eligible women who had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer based on both clinical and imaging criteria were enrolled in this study. Serum levels of CA 125 and HE4 were checked before surgery and all patients underwent complete surgical staging. After completion of the pathological evaluation, data were entered in SPSS version 23. One hundred and ten individuals were enrolled in our study. We divided cases between two groups: stage I to III b and stage IIIc to IV. Serum level of HE4 >170 pmol/L can predict optimal cytoreductive surgery before operation. (sensitivity:80% and specificity 70%) and serum level of CA 125 > 320 UI/mL can predict optimal cytoreductive surgery before operation. (sensitivity:80% and specificity 70%). Our data demonstrated a negative predictive value of about 80% for both HE4 and CA125. Based on these cut-off, unnecessary surgery can be avoided in many cases, however, it is unwise to ignore clinical performance and radiological findings. Nevertheless, we can say the evaluation of tumor markers is feasible and helpful in predicting optimal surgery."
Societal factors that influence wait-listing for transplantation are complex and poorly understood. Social determinants of health (SDOH) affect rates of and outcomes after transplantation.
"Liver transplantation is a life-saving treatment for children who are in liver failure. The survival rate index is used to assess the success rate of liver transplantation. The study aimed to assess the survival rate of liver transplantation in children. We searched 5 international databases in this study, including Medline/PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar, for published articles by the end of 2020. Also, meta-regression analysis was performed based on the year of the study, and subgroup analysis was performed according to continents. A total of 425 titles were reviewed. Based on the results, 96 articles were entered in the meta-analysis. Established on the random-effect model, the survival rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 years of transplantation were 86.62%, 77.74%, 73.95%, and 68.60%, respectively. Also, based on the meta-regression results, there was a relationship between the year of the study and the survival rate, as the study year gets more recent, the survival rate is increased. This study can provide documented and comprehensive evidence which can be the basis of many policies and decisions in various sectors of health development, including evaluating treatment options and health interventions in transplantation."
Cancers seldom happen in childhood age and awareness of accurate cancer incidence is essential in order to preventive programs. This study aimed to estimate the childhood cancer incidence in Iran using the three-source capture -recapture method.
Chronic subdural hematomas (CSDH) is frequently encountered in neurosurgical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors associated with the outcome of Burr Hole Craniotomy.
"Elevated blood pressure is associated with cardiovascular disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease. In this study, we examined the socioeconomic inequality and its related factors in prevalence, Awareness, Treatment and Control (ATC) of hypertension (HTN) in Iran."
"Research on the care of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients has been primarily in populations of European ancestry. However, the incidence of IBD, which comprises Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is increasing in different populations around the world. In this comprehensive review, we examine the epidemiology, clinical presentations, disease phenotypes, treatment outcomes, social determinants of health, and genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of IBD in Black and Hispanic patients in the United States. To improve health equity of underserved minorities with IBD, we identified the following priority areas: access to care, accurate assessment of treatment outcomes, incorporation of Black and Hispanic patients in therapeutic clinical trials, and investigation of environmental factors that lead to the increase in disease incidence."
"The prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and reduction of its disparities necessitates research on the role of contextual social determinants of health. Empirical evidence on the role of contextual factors (e.g., neighborhood built and social environment) in these disparities is extremely limited. Oluyomi and colleagues conducted a Texas-wide study examining the contribution of neighborhood-level socioeconomic deprivation, proxied by the area deprivation index on HCC disparities. Future studies are needed to complement and extend these findings. See related article by Oluyomi et al., p. 1402."
The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is increasing in minority groups across the USA. There are racial and ethnic disparities in IBD care and outcomes that are rooted in historical injustice and inequities in the social determinants of health.
"This cross-sectional study aimed to determine potential factors with a strong association with metabolic syndrome (MetS) among obesity and lipid-related parameters, and liver enzymes, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and blood pressure (BP) as well as some sociodemographic factors in elderly over 60 years old from a sample of Birjand Longitudinal Aging Study (BLAS)."
"We aimed to investigate the clinical, laboratory, and electrocardiographic (ECG) findings of colchicine poisoning and to evaluate if there is a correlation between them and the two major outcomes of this toxicity which are respiratory/cardiovascular failure and death."
"Filipino Americans (FAs) are the third-largest Asian American subgroup in the United States (US). Some studies showed that FAs experience more cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) than other Asian subgroups and non-Hispanic Whites. The increased prevalence of CMD observed in FAs could be due to genetics and social/dietary lifestyles. While FAs are ascribed as an Asian group, they have higher burdens of CMD, and adverse social determinants of health compared to other Asian subgroups. Therefore, studies to elucidate how FAs might develop CMD and respond to medications used to manage CMD are warranted. The ultimate goals of this study are to identify potential mechanisms for reducing CMD burden in FAs and to optimize therapeutic drug selection. Collectively, these investigations could reduce the cardiovascular health disparities among FAs."
"Mammography is the most effective method for early detection of breast cancer (BC), however, it has performed in low-level. The aim of this study was to investigate the determinants of mammography in Iran."
There is no compelling evidence to prove an association between serum free L-carnitine levels and changes in left ventricular (LV) geometry. The present study aimed to evaluate a possible association between these parameters.
"The first large serosurvey in Iran found a SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence of 17.1% among the general population in the first wave of the epidemic by April, 2020. The purpose of the current study was to assess the seroprevalence of COVID-19 infection among Iranian general population after the third wave of the disease."

"It has been over 50 years since the Stonewall Inn Riots in June 1969, a seminal event for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and other sexual and gender-diverse minorities (LGBTQI+, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and everyone else) rights movement. However, sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals still face discrimination and harassment due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. As such, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities has identified SGM communities as a ""health disparity population."" Broadly, there are higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, substance use and abuse, mental health conditions, obesity and eating disorders, certain cancers (breast, cervical, and anorectal), and cardiovascular disease in SGM communities. Transgender patients, especially those of color, are more likely to be uninsured, experience discrimination, and be denied health care than cisgender patients. In addition, SGM individuals have twice the risk of lifetime exposure to emotional, physical, and sexual trauma compared with heterosexuals. It is expected all these factors would negatively affect digestive health as well. This review summarizes the effects of social determinants of health and discrimination on health care access, highlights important digestive diseases to consider in the SGM population, and offers solutions to improve and prioritize the health of these communities. We aim to draw attention to SGM-specific issues that affect gastrointestinal health and spur research that is desperately lacking."
"Although there are well-documented challenges in access to living donor liver transplant (LDLT) among recipients, it is unclear whether living liver donors (LLDs) face similar challenges."
"Recent reports of lead poisoning suggest that people who use opium may be exposed to high amounts of lead. Here, we investigate the association between opium use and blood lead levels (BLL) in a population-based cohort study."
"Hypertension as a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases is among the leading causes of death worldwide. The relationship between elevated serum levels of liver enzymes and hypertension has been reported in limited studies, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports in the literature on this issue in the southeast of Iran. Our investigation aimed at evaluating the relation between ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP with hypertension in the Rafsanjan Cohort Study, a city in Kerman Province, Iran."
"Liver cancer is a highly fatal condition disproportionately impacting American Indian populations. A thorough understanding of the existing literature is needed to inform region-specific liver cancer prevention efforts for American Indian people. This integrative review explores extant literature relevant to liver cancer in American Indian populations in Arizona and identifies factors of structural inequality affecting these groups. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines informed the methodology, and a literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycInfo for articles including Arizona American Indian adults and liver disease outcomes. Seven articles met the inclusion criteria in the final review. Five of the studies used an observational study design with secondary analysis. One article used a quasiexperimental approach, and another employed a community-engagement method resulting in policy change. The results revealed a lack of empirical evidence on liver cancer prevention, treatment, and health interventions for American Indian populations in Arizona. Research is needed to evaluate the high rates of liver disease and cancer to inform culturally relevant interventions for liver cancer prevention. Community-engaged research that addresses structural inequality is a promising approach to improve inequities in liver cancer for American Indian people."
This study evaluated the association between neighborhood-level social determinants of health (SDOH) and liver transplantation (LT) among patients with cirrhosis who have universal access to health care.

"Cohort studies play essential roles in assessing causality, appropriate interventions. The study, Post-crash Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN Traffic Safety and Health Cohort, aims to investigate the common health consequences of road traffic injuries (RTIs) postcrash through multiple follow-ups."
"In this cross-sectional population-based study, we used the baseline data of the Prospective Epidemiologic Research Studies in IrAN cohort study collected in Iran from 2014 to 2020. The main outcomes were the prevalence of hypertension and proportion of awareness, treatment, and control based on the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline compared to the seventh report of the Joint National Committee (JNC7). Of the total of 163,770 participants, aged 35-70 years, 55.2% were female. The sex-age standardized prevalence of hypertension was 22.3% (95% CI 20.6, 24.1) based on the JNC7 guideline and 36.5% (31.1, 41.8) based on the ACC/AHA guideline. A total of 24,312 participants [14.1% (10.1, 18.1)] were newly diagnosed based on the ACC/AHA guideline. Compared to adults diagnosed with hypertension based on the JNC7 guideline, the newly diagnosed participants were mainly young literate males who had low levels of risk factors and were free from conventional comorbidities of hypertension. About 30.7% (25.9, 35.4) of them (4.3% of the entire population) were eligible for pharmacologic intervention based on the ACC/AHA guideline. Implementation of the new guideline may impose additional burden on health systems. However, early detection and management of elevated blood pressure may reduce the ultimate burden of hypertension in Iran."
"Bladder cancer (BC) is the 10th most common type of cancer worldwide and the fourth most common type of cancer in Iran. Opium use is considered as one of the risk factors for BC. We aim to assess the association between various parameters of opium use, which in Iran is mainly ingested or smoked in various forms, and the risk of BC."
"Organ transplant is the preferred treatment for end-stage organ disease, yet the majority of patients with end-stage organ disease are never placed on the transplant waiting list. Limited access to the transplant waiting list combined with the scarcity of the organ pool result in over 100,000 deaths annually in the United States. Patients face unique barriers to referral and acceptance for organ transplant based on social determinants of health, and patients from disenfranchised groups suffer from disproportionately lower rates of transplantation. Our objective was to review the literature describing disparities in access to organ transplantation based on social determinants of health to integrate the existing knowledge and guide future research."
"Several serious attempts to treat colorectal cancer have been made in recent decades. However, no effective treatment has yet been discovered due to the complexities of its etiology."
Low back pain (LBP) is a common health condition in populations. Limited large-scale population-based studies evaluated the prevalence and predictors of LBP in developing countries. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with LBP among the Iranian population.
"So far, no comprehensive studies have been performed to assess burden and determinants of anemia in Iran. In the present study, we aimed to answer this query using the data obtained from the Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN (PERSIAN)."
"Aflatoxin is one of the dangerous fungal toxins that is produced in the presence of humidity and heat and lack of proper storage conditions and is considered as a dangerous substance threatening human health. The work aimed to determination of aflatoxin M1 (AFM) level in raw, pasteurized, and sterilized milks offered in the study area and to evaluate the risk of its consumption. In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 60 samples of milk types supplied in the region were collected during two series of sampling (cold and hot seasons) and analyzed by ELISA method. LCR, MoE, and HI indices were used to assess the possible risk of consuming milk containing AFM. In all taken samples AFM was found, the toxin concentration range in the first and second series of sampling was 57.5-270.6 ng/L and 57-185.9 ng/L, respectively. The level of toxin in pasteurized and sterilized milks in both sampling series was higher than raw milks. Based on the obtained data and in order to assess the risk of milk consumption in the target population, associated values with EDI, LCR, MoE, and HI were also calculated and obtained in the range of 0.145-0.3 ng/k.d b.w, 0.0008-0.0017 additional case per one million population, 1892.9-3921.6 and 0.72-1.5 ng/kg b.w, respectively. According to the findings, all samples tested are contaminated and although it is within the range of the WHO recommendation, however, based on the calculated indicators, the risk of liver cancer threatens the consumers of these milks. Therefore, it is necessary to manage this issue through educational control and monitoring measures."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of death in patients with cirrhosis and has a rising mortality rate in the United States.
"One fifth of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can increase the risk of cirrhosis, cancer, and death. To date, reported predictors of NASH progression have been heterogeneous.We identified determinants of fibrosis progression in patients with NASH in the United States using physician-reported data from the real-world Global Assessment of the Impact of NASH (GAIN) study, including demographics and clinical characteristics, NASH diagnostic information, fibrosis stage, comorbidities, and treatment. We developed a logistic regression model to assess the likelihood of fibrosis progression since diagnosis, controlling for sociodemographic and clinical variables. An iterative nested model selection approach using likelihood ratio test determined the final model.A total of 989 patients from the GAIN US cohort were included; 46% were women, 58% had biopsy-proven NAFLD, and 74% had fibrosis stage F0-F2 at diagnosis. The final multivariable model included age, years since diagnosis, sex, employment status, smoking status, obesity, fibrosis stage, diagnostic biopsy, Vitamin E, and liver transplant proposed at diagnosis. Odds of progression were 17% higher (odds ratio, 1.17 [95% CI: 1.11-1.23]; P < .001) with each year since NASH diagnosis, 41% lower (0.59 [0.38-0.90]; P = .016) for women than men, 131% higher (2.31 [1.30-4.03]; P = .004) for smokers versus non-smokers, and 89% higher (1.89 [1.26-2.86]; P = .002) with obesity. Odds of progression were also higher with part-time, retired, unemployed, and unable to work due to NASH status versus full-time employment, and when a liver transplant was proposed at diagnosis.Disease duration and severity, obesity, smoking, and lack of full-time employment were significant determinants of fibrosis progression. These findings can support clinical and health-policy decisions to improve NASH management in the US."
"We aimed at estimating the burden of cancer in Kurdistan Province, western Iran during 2011-2017."
"End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is an irreversible impairment of kidney function that leads to permanently dependent on alternative therapies such as hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and renal transplantation. This study aimed to systematically investigate the survival rate of patients with renal transplantation, graft, and its related factors in Iran."
"Using more recent cancer registry data, we analyzed disparities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence by ethnic enclave and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) among Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) and Hispanic populations in California."
"Truck, bus, transit drivers, and men with mobile jobs are at high risk for HIV/AIDS. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of HIV and risky behaviors among truck and bus drivers in Kurdistan province."
"With prevalence high and rising given the close relationship with obesity and diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is progressively becoming the most common chronic liver condition worldwide. However, little is known about the health inequalities in NAFLD distribution and outcomes. This review aims to analyze health inequalities in NAFLD distribution globally and to assess the health disparities in NAFLD-related outcomes. We conducted a scoping review of global health inequalities in NAFLD distribution and outcomes according to gender/sex, ethnicity/race, and socioeconomic position from PubMed's inception to May 2021. Ultimately, 20 articles were included in the review, most (75%) of them carried out in the United States. Males were found to have a higher NAFLD prevalence (three articles), while available evidence suggests that women have an overall higher burden of advanced liver disease and complications (four articles), whereas they are less likely to be liver-transplanted once cirrhosis develops (one article). In the US, the Hispanic population had the highest NAFLD prevalence and poorer outcomes (seven articles), whereas Whites had fewer complications than other ethnicities (two articles). Patients with low socioeconomic status had higher NAFLD prevalence (four articles) and a higher likelihood of progression and complications (five articles). In conclusion, globally there is a lack of studies analyzing NAFLD prevalence and outcomes according to various axes of inequality through joint intersectional appraisals, and most studies included in our review were based on the US population. Available evidence suggests that NAFLD distribution and outcomes show large inequalities by social group. Further research on this issue is warranted."
"Pediatric gastroenterologists took on a variety of challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, including learning about a new disease and how to recognize and manage it, prevent its spread among their patients and health professions colleagues, and make decisions about managing patients with chronic gastrointestinal and liver problems in light of the threat. They adapted their practice to accommodate drastically decreased numbers of in-person visits, adopting telehealth technologies, and instituting new protocols to perform endoscopies safely. The workforce pipeline was also affected by the impact of the pandemic on trainee education, clinical experience, research, and job searches."
"Social determinants of health (SDH) as outlined by Healthy People 2020 encompasses 5 key domains: economic, education, social and community context, health and health care, and neighborhood and built environment. This article emphasizes pediatric populations and some of the existing SDH and health care disparities seen in pediatric gastroenterology. We specifically review inflammatory bowel disease, endoscopy, bariatric surgery, and liver transplantation. We also examine the burgeoning role of telehealth that has become commonplace since the coronavirus disease 2019 era."
"Diabetes is one of the major comorbidities associated with COVID-19. We aimed to determine the clinical and epidemiological factors associated with the mortality of COVID-19 in diabetic patients in Iran, and also the impact of prescribed antiviral and antibiotics on patients' status."
"Acid suppressants are widely-used classes of medications linked to increased risks of aerodigestive infections. Prior studies of these medications as potentially reversible risk factors for COVID-19 have been conflicting. We aimed to determine the impact of chronic acid suppression use on COVID-19 infection risk while simultaneously evaluating the influence of social determinants of health to validate known and discover novel risk factors. We assessed the association of chronic acid suppression with incident COVID-19 in a 1:1 case-control study of 900 patients tested across three academic medical centers in California, USA. Medical comorbidities and history of chronic acid suppression use were manually extracted from health records by physicians following a pre-specified protocol. Socio-behavioral factors by geomapping publicly-available data to patient zip codes were incorporated. We identified no evidence to support an association between chronic acid suppression and COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.92-1.17, P = 0.515). However, several medical and social features were positive (Latinx ethnicity, BMI ≥ 30, dementia, public transportation use, month of the pandemic) and negative (female sex, concurrent solid tumor, alcohol use disorder) predictors of new infection. These findings demonstrate the value of integrating publicly-available databases with medical data to identify critical features of communicable diseases."
"The factors affecting the dynamics of lengthening of symptoms and serologic responses are not well known. In order to see how the serologic responses change in relation to the clinical features, we selected a group of 472 adults with a positive IgM/IgG antibody test result from a baseline study of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, assessed their COVID-19 and past medical histories, and followed them up in about 3 months. Nearly one-fourth of the subjects were asymptomatic at the baseline; 12.8% subjects became symptomatic at the follow-up (FU) when 39.8% of the subjects had some persisting symptoms. At the baseline, 6.1% showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive, 59.3% only for IgG, and 34.5% for both. At the FU, these figures declined to 0.6, 54.0, and 4.4%, respectively, with the mean IgM and IgG levels declining about 6.3 and 2.5 folds. Blood group A was consistently linked to both sustaining and flipping of the gastrointestinal (GI) and respiratory symptoms. The baseline IgM level was associated with GI symptoms and pre-existing cirrhosis in multivariate models. Both of the baseline and FU IgG levels were strongly associated with age, male, and lung involvement seen in chest computed tomography (CT)-scan. Finally, as compared with antibody decayers, IgM sustainers were found to be more anosmic [mean difference (MD): 11.5%;"
This study investigated how material deprivation in Italy influences the stage of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at diagnosis and the chance of cure.
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver and affects patients of all genders, races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic status. While the causes of HCC are numerous, the primary etiology is cirrhosis from alcohol and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the United States and from infectious agents such as Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C in the developing world. In patients at-risk for developing HCC, screening is recommended with ultrasound imaging and alpha fetoprotein laboratory tests. In socioeconomically vulnerable patients, however, individual-level barriers (eg, insurance status) and contextual-level disparities (eg, health facilities) may not be readily available, thus limiting screening. Additional challenges faced by racial/ethnic minorities can further challenge the spectrum of HCC care and lead to inadequate screening, delayed diagnosis, and unequal access to treatment. Efforts to improve these multilevel factors that lead to screening and treatment disparities are critical to overcoming challenges. Providing health insurance to those without access, improving societal challenges that confine patients to a lower socioeconomic status, and reducing challenges to seeking healthcare can decrease the morbidity and mortality of these patients. Additionally, engaging with communities and allowing them to collaborate in their own healthcare can also help to attenuate these inequities. Through collaborative multidisciplinary change, we can make progress in tackling disparities in vulnerable populations to achieve health equity."
"The Dehgolan Prospective Cohort Study (DehPCS) was conducted to examine and identify risk factors for the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In addition, in order to examine participants' health status, socioeconomic status, behavioral factors, nutritional status, and environmental exposures, the DehPCS collected, analyzed, and stored blood, urine, nail, and hair samples to conduct genetic studies and identify biomarkers and other biological determinants of NCDs. In total, 3,996 adults aged 35 to 70 from the general population participated in the study from February 2018 to March 2019. Of them, 43.7% were women. The first follow-up wave was conducted with 3,995 participants. Information on a wide range of variables was collected, including on socioeconomic status, lifestyle, nutritional status, habits, physical examination findings, medication use, and medical history. Proxy variables such as body mass index, metabolic equivalent task score, wealth index, and macronutrients and micronutrients were calculated. The most common self-reported diseases in descending order were kidney stones, hypertension, and fatty liver. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was 9.3% and 33.4%, respectively. All data, samples, and measurements will be collected again at 5-year intervals. Thus, it will be possible to examine time-dependent changes in the risk factors of NCDs. The DehPCS can be used to study the relationships among genetics, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and environmental risk factors and the most prevalent NCDs in case-cohort studies using a nested case-control design that will be applied to the cohort infrastructure. Researchers can also submit pre-proposals via the following web address: http://c.ddrc.ac.ir/persianaccess/Account/Login."

A major episode of lead poisoning caused by lead-adulterated opium occurred in Iran in 2016. Patients were removed from exposure and treated with chelating agents. A subset of those patients was evaluated in this follow-up study to evaluate treatment efficacy in relation to patient outcome.
"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a crisis that disproportionately affected populations already disadvantaged with respect to access to health care systems and adequate medical care and treatments. Understanding how and where health care disparities are most widespread is an important starting point for exploring opportunities to mitigate such disparities, especially within our patient population with liver disease. In a webinar in LiverLearning, we discussed the impact of the pandemic on the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, highlighting the disproportionate effects on infection rates and death for certain ethnic minorities, those socioeconomically disadvantaged and living in higher density areas, and those working in health care and other essential jobs. We set forth a ""call to action"" for members of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the larger community of providers of liver disease care to generate viable solutions to improve access to care and vaccination rates of our patients against COVID-19, and in general help reduce health care disparities and improve the health of disadvantaged populations within their communities. Solutions will likely involve personalized interventions and messaging for communities that honor local leaders and embrace the diverse needs and different cultural sensitivities of our unique patient populations."
"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease globally and is estimated to affect approximately 25% of the world's population. Data about the prevalence and incidence of NAFLD in Africa are scarce, but the prevalence is estimated to be 13·5% for the general population. This is likely to be an underestimate considering the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases, particularly the rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, driven by the overlapping challenges of food insecurity, nutritional transition, and associated increased consumption of calorie-dense foods. Establishing the true prevalence of NAFLD, raising public awareness around the risk factors behind the increase in NAFLD, and proactively addressing all components of metabolic syndrome will be important to combat this silent epidemic, which will have long-term health-care costs and economic consequences for the region."
Transport-related injuries (TIs) are a substantial public health concern for all regions of the world. The present study quantified the burden of TIs and deaths in the Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) in 2017 by sex and age.
"There is limited information regarding the protective factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This research is focused on analyzing the role of vitamin D and albumin in the severity, progression, or possible prevention of COVID-19 infection. In this case-control study, 191 patients and 203 healthy individuals were enrolled. Blood samples were taken to test the albumin and vitamin D levels of both groups. Our results show a direct association of vitamin D deficiency with the infection of COVID-19 and severity. According to our findings, 84.4% of patients with COVID-19 in this study had vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, the average level of albumin was significantly decreased in those infected patients who had respiratory symptoms. In the present study, a considerable negative correlation was established between the levels of vitamin D and the severity of COVID-19 infection. This reflects on the immunomodulatory and inhibitory nature of vitamin D to the viral replication."
"The social determinants of health, defined as the conditions in which we live, learn, work, and play, undoubtedly impact health outcomes. Social adversity in childhood perpetuates over the life course and has consequences extending into adulthood. This link between social adversity and adverse outcomes extends to children undergoing liver transplant, with children from socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods experiencing a greater burden of morbidity and mortality after transplant. Yet, we lack an in-depth understanding of how to address social adversity for these children. Herein, we lay out a strategy to develop and test interventions to address social adversity for children undergoing liver transplant. To do so, we believe that more granular data on how specific social risk factors (e.g., food insecurity) impact outcomes for children after liver transplant are needed. This will provide the liver transplant community with knowledge on the most pressing problems. Then, using the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's framework for integrating social needs into medical care, the health system can start to develop and test health system interventions. We believe that attending to our patients' social adversity will realize improved outcomes for children undergoing liver transplant."
"Recent evidence suggests that, in some foci, elimination of onchocerciasis from Africa may be feasible with mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin. To achieve continental elimination of transmission, mapping surveys will need to be conducted across all implementation units (IUs) for which endemicity status is currently unknown. Using boosted regression tree models with optimised hyperparameter selection, we estimated environmental suitability for onchocerciasis at the 5 × 5-km resolution across Africa. In order to classify IUs that include locations that are environmentally suitable, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify an optimal threshold for suitability concordant with locations where onchocerciasis has been previously detected. This threshold value was then used to classify IUs (more suitable or less suitable) based on the location within the IU with the largest mean prediction. Mean estimates of environmental suitability suggest large areas across West and Central Africa, as well as focal areas of East Africa, are suitable for onchocerciasis transmission, consistent with the presence of current control and elimination of transmission efforts. The ROC analysis identified a mean environmental suitability index of 0·71 as a threshold to classify based on the location with the largest mean prediction within the IU. Of the IUs considered for mapping surveys, 50·2% exceed this threshold for suitability in at least one 5 × 5-km location. The formidable scale of data collection required to map onchocerciasis endemicity across the African continent presents an opportunity to use spatial data to identify areas likely to be suitable for onchocerciasis transmission. National onchocerciasis elimination programmes may wish to consider prioritising these IUs for mapping surveys as human resources, laboratory capacity, and programmatic schedules may constrain survey implementation, and possibly delaying MDA initiation in areas that would ultimately qualify."
"Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to prevent vitamin D deficiency, but various factors can affect the response to supplementation. Data mining is a statistical method for pulling out information from large databases. We aimed to evaluate the factors influencing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in response to supplementation of vitamin D using a random forest (RF) model. Data were extracted from the survey of ultraviolet intake by nutritional approach study. Vitamin D levels were measured at baseline and at the end of study to evaluate the responsiveness. We examined the relationship between 76 potential influencing factors on vitamin D response using RF. We found several features that were highly correlated to the serum vitamin D response to supplementation by RF including anthropometric factors (body mass index [BMI], free fat mass [FFM], fat percentage, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]), liver function tests (serum gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], total bilirubin, total protein), hematological parameters (mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC], hematocrit), and measurement of insulin sensitivity (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance). BMI, total bilirubin, FFM, and GGT were found to have a positive relationship and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, MCV, MCHC, fat percentage, total protein, and WHR were found to have a negative correlation to vitamin D concentration in response to supplementation. The accuracy of RF in predicting the response was 93% compared to logistic regression, for which the accuracy was 40%, in the evaluation of the correlation of the components of the data set to serum vitamin D."

Gaps in coordination and transitions of care for liver cirrhosis contribute to high rates of hospital readmissions and inadequate quality of care. Understanding the differences in the mental models held by specialty and primary care physicians may help to identify the root causes of problems in the coordination of cirrhosis care.
"Organ allocation in liver transplantation (LT) remains imperfect. Periodic center reviews ensure programs transparently evaluate the impact of practice on access to transplantation, reflecting, in particular, patient (primary disease, social determinants) and program (deceased versus live donation) factors. Adult Ontario residents waitlisted for first LT at Toronto General Hospital from November 2012 to May 2019 were reviewed. Analyses were performed between distance to transplant center, income, education level, population density and primary liver disease, with LT, deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT), living donor liver transplant (LDLT), and delisting. Of 1735 listed patients, 549 were delisted (32%), while 1071 were transplanted (62%), with 819 DDLT recipients (76%) and 252 LDLT recipients (24%), while 115 (7%) remained actively listed at data census. On univariate analysis, DDLT recipients lived 30% closer (median 39.7 versus 60.6 km; P < 0.001), lived in more populous areas (median 8501.0 versus 6868.5 people in a 1-km radius; P < 0.001), and resided in households that annually earned 10% less (median $92,643.17 versus $102,820.89 Canadian dollars; P < 0.001) compared with LDLT recipients. These findings with population density and income differences between DDLT versus LDLT receival remained significant on multivariate modeling even when accounting for primary liver disease. Primary liver disease was a statistically significant factor on multivariate analyses in LT receival (P = 0.001) as well as DDLT versus LDLT receival (P < 0.001). Of patients listed for end-stage liver disease, more patients with autoimmune cholestatic liver diseases received LDLT (34%-41%) than DDLT (27%-30%); this contrasted with patients with noncholestatic diseases LDLT (8%-19%) versus DDLT (37%-59%) receival (P < 0.001). Review of transplant allocation in a large mixed-donor North American liver transplant program demonstrates how patient social determinants and primary liver disease etiology continue to be significantly associated with ultimate transplantation."
"The COVID-19 pandemic and social justice movement have highlighted the impact of social determinants of health (SDOH) and structural racism in the United States on both access to care and patient outcomes. With the evaluation for liver transplantation being a highly subjective process, there are multiple ways for SDOH to place vulnerable patients at a disadvantage. This policy corner focuses on three different methods to reverse the deleterious effects of SDOH-identify and reduce implicit bias, expand and optimize telemedicine, and improve community outreach."
"Melatonin has shown promising effects in controlling the progress of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), introducing it as a possible candidate for NAFLD treatment. In this context, the current study is aimed to evaluate melatonin's effect on the plasma levels of Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, cholesterol, triglyceride, and liver aminotransferases in NAFLD patients. NAFLD and melatonin, as well as their related terms, were searched in electronic databases, until May 1st, 2020. The initial search identified 1152 studies. Considering inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final seven articles were included in the study. The methodology of the articles was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Alanine transaminase levels were significantly lowered with melatonin treatment but not earlier than the 4th week (P = 0.010 and 0.519, respectively). Aspartate aminotransferase levels didn't show significant alteration before 4 weeks, although exhibiting substantial decline in total (P = 0.697 and 0.008, respectively). Alkaline phosphatase changes under 4 weeks of follow-up were not significant (P = 0.3), however, it decreased significantly in total (P = 0.006). A significant decline was detected in triglyceride levels after melatonin treatment (P = 0.015). There was a significant reduction in cholesterol levels (P = 0.005). Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels were also significantly different after the administration of melatonin (P < 0.001). Melatonin could reduce the progress of NAFLD. It might also decrement hepatic function parameters. Thus, it could be used for managing NAFLD and possibly as part of the treatment plan for patients with NAFLD."
"Autoimmune liver diseases are attributed to a complex interplay of biologic, acquired, and environmental factors. Increased prevalence, later stage at presentation, worse response to standard therapy, and transplant-related disparities have all been reported in racial and ethnic minorities such as Black and Latinx patients with autoimmune liver diseases. While biology and inherited genetic predispositions may partly explain these disparities, definitive and universal genetic variations underlying these differences in outcomes have not been defined. Nonetheless, socioeconomic status, access to health care, environmental and societal factors, and implicit provider bias can all contribute to poor patient outcomes. There remains an unmet need to understand and mitigate the factors contributing to health inequity in autoimmune liver diseases. In this review, we summarize the data on racial and ethnic disparities in presentation, treatment response, and outcomes pertaining to autoimmune liver diseases in minority populations, on the premise that understanding disparities is the first step toward reaching health equity."
"Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhoea. This bacterium infects the epithelial cells of the cervix of women and the urethra of men. However, its disease symptoms in the lower genitalia are found only in a small percentage of people. This study aimed to compare the frequency of N. gonorrhoeae genital infection among two groups of pregnant women, those with spontaneous abortions and those with normal pregnancies. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Western Iran. It included 417 women: 109 of whom had spontaneous abortions, 109 had normal deliveries, 100 were fertile, and 99 were infertile. Specific primers were used and DNA was extracted by endocervical swabs. A polymerase chain reaction test was then performed to detect N. gonorrhoeae. Data analysis was performed using the chi-squared test and t-tests. In all the above steps, a level of 5% was considered statistically significant, and the average ages in women with normal delivery, women with spontaneous abortion, fertile women, and infertile women were 27.8 ± 4.87, 29.6 ± 5.9, 32.1 ± 5.1, and 29.1 ± 6.3 years, respectively. The total frequency of N. gonorrhoeae infection was 0 (0%). The prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae infection was zero, and the disease was not associated with spontaneous abortion or infertility."

"The novel coronavirus outbreak began in late December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide, critically impacting public health systems. A number of already approved and marketed drugs are being tested for repurposing, including Favipiravir. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42020180032). All clinical trials which addressed the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in comparison to other control groups for treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 were included. We searched electronic databases including LitCovid/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scientific Information Database up to 31 December 2020. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. All analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2, and the risk ratio index was calculated. Egger and Begg test was used for assessing publication bias. Nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant clinical improvement in the Favipiravir group versus the control group during seven days after hospitalization (RR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41; P = 0.001). Viral clearance was more in 14 days after hospitalization in Favipiravir group than control group, but this finding marginally not significant (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25; P = 0.094). Requiring supplemental oxygen therapy in the Favipiravir group was 7% less than the control group, (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.67-1.28; P = 0.664). Transferred to ICU and adverse events were not statistically different between two groups. The mortality rate in the Favipiravir group was approximately 30% less than the control group, but this finding not statistically significant. Favipiravir possibly exerted no significant beneficial effect in the term of mortality in the general group of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. We should consider that perhaps the use of antiviral once the patient has symptoms is too late and this would explain their low efficacy in the clinical setting."

"BACKGROUND Cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common malignant liver cancer. Its early diagnosis plays an important role in the success of treatment. The aim of this study was to compare the use of cold forceps biopsy without cholangioscopy with brush cytology in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS In this prospective study, we enrolled 19 patients. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed for all individuals. Sampling was performed from the narrowing site using the brush method. Then, a cold forceps biopsy was performed under fluoroscopy. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 63.31 ± 11.12 years and most of them were men (63.16 %). The brush cytology and the cold forceps biopsy diagnosed 31.85% and 68.42% of the samples as cholangiocarcinoma, respectively. According to the McNemar test, there was a statistically significant difference between the diagnostic results of the brush cytology and cold forceps biopsy. So that more cholangiocarcinoma cases were diagnosed using forceps biopsy ("
"The exact mechanism of Parkinson's disease (PD) is not fully understood yet, but it is suggested that inflammation is one of its contributing factors. Among several inflammatory factors, adipokines, especially leptin may have a great role in this mechanism; since it is not only causing inflammation, but it can also play other roles in the body that may contribute to the symptoms described for PD. Regarding the contradictions in the association of serum leptin levels with Parkinson's disease, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to have a more accurate estimation of this relationship."

"The present study aimed to determine the average concentration of some metals, including cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and lead (Pb) in the chicken, hen's liver, and gizzard in the east of Iran. Estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risk (CR) were calculated. In this cross-sectional study, fifty one samples including chicken, hen's liver and gizzard were obtained from Birjand, Iran. Measurement of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb was carried out by using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). All of the measured metals were detected in 100 % of the samples. The metals had a different distribution pattern. The highest concentration of Cd and Cu was in the liver samples while the Cr and Ni had the highest levels in the chicken. Pb concentration was at the highest level in the gizzard. The least amount of Cr, Ni, and Pb was found in the liver while Cu had the least content in the muscle. EDI had an acceptable level, but the highest daily intake of all studied metals was through muscle. Cr had the highest THQ and it was more than one in the meat. HI in chicken was more than one. Liver and gizzard of hens had a neglectable HI. CR was neglectable in the case of both Cd and Pb, but it was considerable for Cr and Ni. The consumption of chicken in both adults and children may pose a significant health risk for consumers."

"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed healthcare inequities in the USA and highlighted the importance of social conditions in shaping the health of persons. In the field of hepatology, social determinants of health (SDOH) are closely linked to disparities in liver disease prevalence, outcomes, and access to treatment. The economic disruption and physical distancing policies brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have further exacerbated these disparities, and may have long-lasting health consequences for marginalized patients with chronic liver disease. There are several ways that hepatology providers can bridge the gap in health equity through addressing SDOH, extending from the individual to the community and societal levels. Interventions at the individual level include implementation of systematic screening for social barriers in our hepatology practices to identify gaps in the care cascade. At the community and societal levels, interventions include creating collaborative partnerships with public health workers to expand healthcare access to the community, increasing funding for research investigating the association of SDOH, health disparities, and liver disease, engaging in advocacy to support policy reform that tackles the upstream social determinants, and addressing racism and implicit bias. As hepatology practices adapt to the ""new normal,"" now is the time for us to address our patients' social needs within the context of healthcare delivery and reimagine ways in which to provide care to best serve our most vulnerable patients with liver disease in the COVID-19 era and beyond."

"The present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of the signaling pathways mutation rate in the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers in a systematic review and meta-analysis study. The study was performed based on the PRISMA criteria. Random models by confidence interval (CI: 95%) were used to calculate the pooled estimate of prevalence via Metaprop command. The pooled prevalence indices of signal transduction pathway mutations in gastric cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer were 5% (95% CI: 3-8%), 12% (95% CI: 8-18%), 17% (95% CI: 14-20%), and 20% (95% CI: 5-41%), respectively. Also, the mutation rates for Wnt pathway and MAPK pathway were calculated to be 23% (95% CI, 14-33%) and 20% (95% CI, 17-24%), respectively. Moreover, the most popular genes were APC (in Wnt pathway), KRAS (in MAPK pathway) and PIK3CA (in PI3K pathway) in the colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer while they were beta-catenin and CTNNB1 in liver cancer. The most altered pathway was Wnt pathway followed by the MAPK pathway. In addition, pancreatic cancer was found to be higher under the pressure of mutation compared with others based on pooled prevalence analysis. Finally, APC mutations in colorectal cancer, KRAS in gastric cancer, and pancreatic cancer were mostly associated gene alterations."
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Survival rates are among the most important factors in quality control and assessment of treatment protocols. This study was aimed to assess the survival rate of colorectal cancer in Eastern Mediterranean Region Countries. In the present study we comprehensively searched 6 international databases including PubMed/Medline, ProQuest, Scopus, Embase, Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar for published articles until November 2018. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Form for Cohort Studies was applied to evaluate the quality of included studies. The heterogeneity of papers was assessed with the Cochran Test and I-Square statistics. Meta-regression test was performed based on publication year, sample size and Human Development Index (HDI) of each study. Among the total of 1023 titles found in the systematic search, 43 studies were eligible to be included in the present meta-analysis. According to the results, the 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rate of patients with Colorectal Cancer was 88.07% (95% CI, 83.22-92.92), 70.67% (95% CI, 66.40-74.93) and, 57.26% (95% CI, 50.43-64.10); respectively. Furthermore, Meta-regressions did not show significant correlations between survival rate and year, sample size or Human Development Index. Survival rates, especially the 5-year survival rate in the EMRO were less than European countries and the USA. Documented and comprehensive evidence-based findings of the present meta-analysis can be used to enhance policies and outcomes of different medical areas including prophylaxis, treatment and health related objectives in colorectal cancer."

"Solidarity in the general sense means unity or agreement of feeling or action, especially among individuals with a common interest; or mutual support within a group. There are different ways of standing in solidarity in different kinds of literatures. One of the most important ways is to advocate. Advocacy is a win-win strategy and a process of supporting and enabling people to express their views and concerns. In the end, I think sharing different types of solidarity can be one of the drivers that stimulate the solidarity itself, and I call on everyone to contribute to this sharing. I hope that this solidarity, which began in the world with the beginning of COVID-19, will not end with its end and will last forever because our world needs coexistence. This may be the only gift to the world from COVID-19."

"Coinfections of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or hepatitis B virus (HBV) with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) are associated with high morbidity and mortality and poor prognosis. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of HCV and/or HBV coinfections among people who inject drugs (PWID) and female sex workers (FSWs) who live with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Data sources were searched from January 2008 to October 2018 in different databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Ovid. Data were analyzed in Stata 14 software using the Metaprop command. The results showed that the prevalence of HCV among PWID and FSWs with HIV/AIDS was 72% (95% CI: 59%-83%) and 40% (95% CI: 0%-94%), respectively. The prevalence of HBV among PWID and FSWs with HIV/AIDS was 8% (95% CI: 5%-13%) and 2% (95% CI: 0%-7%), respectively, and the prevalence of HCV/HBV in PWID with HIV/AIDS was 11% (95% CI: 7%-15%). The highest prevalence of HCV was observed in PWID in the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe regions, and the lowest was observed in the Africa region. The South-East Asia region had the highest prevalence of HBV among PWID, and the Africa region had the lowest prevalence. The high prevalence of HCV coinfection among PWID and FSWs with HIV/AIDS was an alarming health problem and requires appropriate interventions. Therefore, considering that these populations are key populations for HCV elimination, it is recommended to screen them regularly for HCV. In addition, harm reduction and HBV vaccination should be carefully considered."

"Zinc phosphide is a gray to black powder mainly used as a rodenticide. In contact with gastric fluid, it releases phosphine which is the main toxic material of this compound. Phosphine interferes with oxidative respiratory cycle of the cells, but is generally expected to manifest its toxicity with prodromal signs and symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, metabolic acidosis, and increased liver function tests. A 64-year-old man was referred to our center with the history of ingestion of three full table spoons of zinc phosphide powder with only a mild GI discomfort. Abdominal X-ray revealed radiopaque material in epigastric and abdominal right upper quadrant. Despite treatment with polyethylene glycol and completely normal vital signs and lab tests, he experienced sudden cardiac arrest 19 h after admission. Autopsy showed clues of focal myopathy and fibrosis with evidences of ischemia and congestion in cardiac tissue, pulmonary edema, shrunken bilateral kidneys, and nutmeg yellow liver. Toxicology panel confirmed the presence of phosphine and zinc phosphide in the gastric fluid. The patient deteriorated suddenly despite being completely symptom-free during the hours preceding cardiovascular arrest. Since the cardiopulmonary injury is the most rampant cause of early death, checking of the cardiac enzymes and cardiac monitoring could be beneficial for early detection and efficient management of these patients."

Methods A number of domestic and international databases were searched, including IranMedex, Magiran, SID, Scopus, PubMed, IranDoc, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Eligible publications were 160 articles that addressed the prevalence of obesity or overweight. Data were combined using random effects model. Heterogeneity of the studies was examined by Q statistics and the I2 index. Data were analyzed using STATA version 11.1. Results In the 160 reviewed studies, a total of 481,070 individuals (6-20 years) were included. The prevalence of obesity among Iranian students based on body mass index (BMI) was 11% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10%-12%) (in girls 8% [95% CI: 7%-10%] and in boys 11% [95% CI: 10%-13%]). The prevalence of overweight in students based on BMI was 12% (95% CI: 12%-13%) (in girls 13% [95% CI: 11%-14%] and in boys 11% [95% CI: 18%-30%]). The rate of obesity was 13% (95% CI: 11%-16%) in elementary school students, 10% (95% CI: 7%-14%) in secondary school students and 7% (95% CI: 6%-9%) in high school students. Conclusions The prevalence rate of overweight was more than that of obesity with a 1% difference. The prevalence of obesity was higher in boys, while the prevalence of overweight was higher in girls. The prevalence of obesity was higher in primary school students than in secondary school students. This prevalence was higher in secondary school students than in high school students."
Socioeconomic-related inequality in oral hygiene behaviors in Iran is poorly understood. This study aims to measure and decompose socioeconomic-related inequalities in oral hygiene behaviors among middle-aged and elderly adults in Iran.
Drowning is a leading cause of injury-related mortality globally. Unintentional drowning (International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 codes W65-74 and ICD9 E910) is one of the 30 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive causes of injury-related mortality in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. This study's objective is to describe unintentional drowning using GBD estimates from 1990 to 2017.

"Hepatocellular carcinoma or Liver cancer (LC) is the sixth most common cancer and the fourth cause of death worldwide in 2018. There has not been a comprehensive study on the survival rate of patients with LC in Asia yet. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the survival rate of patients with LC in Asian countries. The methodology of the present study is based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) statement. The researchers searched five international databases including Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Knowledge and ProQuest until July 1, 2018. We also searched Google Scholar for detecting grey literature. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Form was used to evaluate the quality of selected papers. A total of 1425 titles were retrieved. 63 studies met the inclusion criteria. Based on the random-effect model one-year, three-year and five-year survival rate of LC were 34.8 % (95 % CI; 30.3-39.3), 19 % (95 % CI ; 18.2-21.8) and 18.1 % (95 % CI ;16.1-20.1) respectively. According to the results of our study, the LC survival rate in Asian countries is relatively lower than in Europe and North America."

"This article describes the characteristics of the health system and reviews the history of health technology assessment (HTA) in Iran, including its inception, processes, challenges, and lessons learned. This study was conducted by analyzing existing documents, reports, and guidelines related to HTA and published articles in the field. HTA in Iran has been established since the late 2000s and was first introduced as a secretariat by the Deputy of Health at the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. The mission of the HTA office is to systematically assess technologies to improve evidence-informed decision making. Despite its 10 years of existence, HTA in Iran still faces some challenges. The most pressing problems currently facing HTA in Iran include conflicts of interest among researchers performing the HTAs, the absence of a systematic structure for identifying and introducing new technologies, the lack of interest in HTA results among high-level policy makers, and the lack of external oversight for HTA projects."

"Since 2000, many countries have achieved considerable success in improving child survival, but localized progress remains unclear. To inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2-to end preventable child deaths by 2030-we need consistently estimated data at the subnational level regarding child mortality rates and trends. Here we quantified, for the period 2000-2017, the subnational variation in mortality rates and number of deaths of neonates, infants and children under 5 years of age within 99 low- and middle-income countries using a geostatistical survival model. We estimated that 32% of children under 5 in these countries lived in districts that had attained rates of 25 or fewer child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2017, and that 58% of child deaths between 2000 and 2017 in these countries could have been averted in the absence of geographical inequality. This study enables the identification of high-mortality clusters, patterns of progress and geographical inequalities to inform appropriate investments and implementations that will help to improve the health of all populations."
"Cancer and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are now widely recognized as a threat to global development. The latest United Nations high-level meeting on NCDs reaffirmed this observation and also highlighted the slow progress in meeting the 2011 Political Declaration on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases and the third Sustainable Development Goal. Lack of situational analyses, priority setting, and budgeting have been identified as major obstacles in achieving these goals. All of these have in common that they require information on the local cancer epidemiology. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study is uniquely poised to provide these crucial data."

"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are a more persistent and lipophilic group of insecticides. The present study aims to evaluate the residues of OCPs in meat, liver, and kidney of the cattle and sheep. A total of 54 samples were obtained from butcheries and local markets in Birjand, east of Iran. The residual contents of aldrin; dieldrin; dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; and its metabolites (DDTs), endosulfan isomers, endrin, hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs), heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, chlordans, methoxychlor, and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), were analyzed in all samples. OCP residues were extracted by using the QuEChERS technique and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). All of the analyzed OCPs were lower than the detection limit. The findings showed that meat and edible organs marketed in this region enjoyed a good status in terms of the residues of OCP. Monitoring of pesticide residues in meat and edible organs is necessary from the public health point of view."
"Delisting for being ""too sick"" to be transplanted is subjective. Previous work has demonstrated that the mortality of patients delisted for ""too sick"" is unexpectedly low. Transplant centers use their best clinical judgment for determining ""too sick,"" but it is unclear how social determinants influence decisions to delist for ""too sick."" We hypothesized that social determinants and Donor Service Area (DSA) characteristics may be associated with determination of ""too sick"" to transplant."

"Background The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of D-penicillamine in the treatment of lead poisoning mainly in the outpatient setting. Methods In a case series study performed during the recent epidemic of lead poisoning in Iran, lead-poisoned patients referring to our outpatient clinic were treated with 250-mg D-penicillamine capsules administered every 6 h for 5 or 10 days based on availability of the medication. They were recommended to re-check blood lead level (BLL) 4 weeks after cessation of the treatment and refer to our clinic again. Results In 63 patients with lead poisoning but without signs and symptoms of lead encephalopathy, median BLL was 106 [84, 131] μg/dL on presentation, which declined to a mean of 52.6 ± 28.8 μg/dL after a median treatment period of 7 [5, 10] days (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the 5- and 10-day treatment protocols regarding complications and recovery. Treatment had resulted in a median decrease of 54 μg/dL [33, 90] (range: -20 to 231 μg/dL) in the patients' BLLs (33.9% declined in BLL measurements; range: -29.69% to 99.06%). Conclusions D-penicillamine may be an acceptable substitute treatment in adult lead poisoning. Although our sample size was limited, we could not detect any serious adverse effects in our cases showing that D-penicillamine resulted in acceptable recovery rates. This may be helpful especially in epidemics with limitations in antidote access."
"The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the world is 10-15%, and it is currently the most common chronic disease among children.

"Preterm birth and small for gestational age (SGA) are major contributors to neonatal mortality in India. However, social determinates of preterm births and SGA are poorly characterized. We use population-based data from a health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) in rural West Bengal, India, to examine risk factors for preterm birth and SGA. HDSS pregnancy cohort data for 2430 pregnant women were used in this analysis. Of 2430 pregnancies, 16% were preterm births and 38.2% were SGA. Results from logistic regression reveal that higher maternal education (≥11 years) was associated with reduced risk of preterm births and SGA. Greater wealth quintile was also associated with decreased risk of preterm births and SGA (p-value for trend: <0.05). In light of the findings, ensuring effective coverage of preterm and SGA interventions among women of low socioeconomic status will be essential to mitigate the large burden of preterm births and SGA."
"This study aimed to evaluate the mean concentration of cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) in the meat and offal of cow and sheep. Also, the estimated daily intake (EDI) and health risk of these metals were calculated. Analysis of metals was undertaken by the use of an inductively coupled plasma-optic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). All samples were contaminated with all metals. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear differentiation of cow and sheep in both the kidney and liver samples. In the liver and kidney, level of Cd, Cu, and Pb were positively correlated. The highest target hazard quotients (THQs) were calculated for Pb. Cd level in cow kidney had the highest carcinogenic rate (CR). Although, hazard index (HI) was lower than one, consumption of muscle especially in children should be noticed in both national and international consumers due to higher level of HI."
Hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer (LC) is one of most important cancer around the world. There are several reports about LC incidence from various Iranian locations with conflicting results.

"Today, one of the most important global public health challenges is represented by hepatitis C virus (HCV), which imposes relevant costs. Globally speaking, the median cost of HCV-related complications ranges from $280 for an uncomplicated hepatitis to $139,070 for a liver transplantation. There are effective therapies for HCV patients worldwide, which has increased the hope of improving the process of managing and curing these patients. The adherence of patients to the pharmacological treatment and the use of effective drugs in the management of HCV disease are of crucial importance for health policy- and decision-makers. Studies show that, globally, insurance coverage for patients with HCV is not adequate in that still many patients are not covered by insurance programs. This issue as well as the economic conditions of countries are very serious challenges for ensuring an effective treatment. The most important and greatest help currently available to ensure HCV treatment is to implement plans to reduce costs and support patients. Some studies have shown that the expansion of coverage by private payers seems able to generate positive spillover benefits to public insures. Insurers, in addition to maintaining and increasing their own interests, are trying to increase their social status as a sponsor of patients. In conclusion, HCV disease requires serious policies and affordable insurance coverage."
"Co-infection of human tuberculosis (TB) and intestinal parasites infections (IPIs) is a public health problem, especially in low- and middle-income countries. There is no data on this issue in Iran. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of IPIs among patients with TB in Iran."
"Deaths of despair (DOD) is a new term appearing in public health literature to describe deaths attributable to suicide, liver disease, and drug overdose. In Florida, suicide and liver disease are the 8th and 10th leading causes of death, respectively. Additional mortality data show that the rate of drug overdose deaths in Florida is 12.5% higher than the suicide death rate. Some have hypothesized that economic social determinants of health (SDH) may be responsible for the recent increase in DOD. The current study, using secondary data, sought to identify what county-level SDH were significantly associated with county-level DOD. Using backward regression methodology, the results of the analysis indicate that 44% of the variance in county-level DOD is significantly associated with six county-level SDH: (a) Recent Medical Checkup, (b) Income, (c) Education Level, (d) Age, (e) Mental Health Professionals, and (f) the Income × Age interaction term. Higher than average income, age, and mental health professionals in a Florida county was associated with significantly higher rates of DOD. Higher than average levels of education and recent checkups in a Florida county were associated with a significant decrease in DOD. Possible explanations and implications are discussed."
"Most chronic diseases follow a socioeconomic gradient with higher rates in lower socioeconomic groups. A growing body of research, however, reveals cancer to be a disease group with very diverse socioeconomic patterning, even demonstrating reverse socioeconomic gradients for certain cancers. To investigate this matter at the German national level for the first time, this study examined socioeconomic inequalities in cancer incidence in Germany, both for all cancers combined as well as for common site-specific cancers. Population-based data on primary cancers newly diagnosed in 2010-2013 was obtained from the German Centre for Cancer Registry Data. Socioeconomic position was assessed at the district level using the German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation, which is a composite index of area-based socioeconomic indicators. Absolute and relative socioeconomic inequalities in total and site-specific cancer incidence were analyzed using multilevel Poisson regression models with the logarithm of the number of residents as an offset. Among men, socioeconomic inequalities in cancer incidence with higher rates in more deprived districts were found for all cancers combined and various site-specific cancers, most pronounced for cancers of the lung, oral and upper respiratory tract, stomach, kidney, and bladder. Among women, higher rates in more deprived districts were evident for kidney, bladder, stomach, cervical, and liver cancer as well as for lymphoid/hematopoietic neoplasms, but no inequalities were evident for all cancers combined. Reverse gradients with higher rates in less deprived districts were found for malignant melanoma and thyroid cancer in both sexes, and in women additionally for female breast and ovarian cancer. Whereas in men the vast majority of all incident cancers occurred at cancer sites showing higher incidence rates in more deprived districts and cancers with a reverse socioeconomic gradient were in a clear minority, the situation was more balanced for women. This is the first national study from Germany examining socioeconomic inequalities in total and site-specific cancer incidence. The findings demonstrate that the socioeconomic patterning of cancer is diverse and follows different directions depending on the cancer site. The area-based cancer inequalities found suggest potentials for population-based cancer prevention and can help develop local strategies for cancer prevention and control."

"Neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage has been linked to increased diabetes risk, but little is known about differences in risk factors in childhood and adulthood in those with high and low neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage, or about the association between long-term neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage and incidence of diabetes in adulthood. We used data from the prospective, population-based Young Finns Study to address these questions."
"Hepatitis B (HB) is one of the major public health problems and a major cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a model-based educational intervention on preventive health behavior of hepatitis B vaccination among women who were going to get married (pending marriage women). Seventy pending marriage women were selected from martial counseling centers. The participants' knowledge, health beliefs model (HBM) constructs, and intention to receive HB vaccination were collected using a questionnaire based on HBM. The questionnaire was based on the Likert-type scale with the score range of 1 to 5. An educational intervention was carried out based on pretest results. The baseline and follow-up level of the variables was statistically significant within the case group. The mean score of the variables in the two groups showed a statistically significant difference in favor of the case group. Our study showed a positive effect of educational intervention on the participants' knowledge, HBM constructs, and intention to receive HB vaccination, indicating that educational intervention based on HBM could be used as an appropriate tool to improve preventive behavior of HB vaccination."

"In the past, communicable diseases caused the highest mortality in Iran. Improvements in socioeconomic status and living standards including access to safe drinking water, along with the inception of Health Houses in the 1980s, have changed disease patterns, decreasing the spread of and deaths from infectious and communicable diseases. The incidence and prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCD), however, have now increased in Iran, accounting for nearly 80% of deaths and disabilities. Without interventions, NCD are predicted to impose a substantial human and economic burden in the next 2 decades. However, Iran's health system is not equipped with the necessary policies to combat this growth and must refocus and reform. Therefore, in the year 2013, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education funded a well-designed nationwide cohort study-Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN (PERSIAN)-in order to assess the burden of NCD and investigate the risk factors associated with them in the different ethnicities and geographical areas of Iran. The PERSIAN Cohort, which aims to include 200000 participants, has 4 components: Adult (main), Birth, Youth and Elderly, which are being carried out in 22 different regions of Iran. Having an enormous dataset along with a biobank of blood, urine, hair and nail samples, the PERSIAN Cohort will serve as an important infrastructure for future implementation research and will provide the evidence needed for new healthcare policies in order to better control, manage and prevent NCD."
Despite advances in prevention of inflammatory milieu with different anti-inflammatory modalities in hemodialysis patients the rate of inflammatory markers in this population are still high.

"The Great East Japan Earthquake occurred on March 11, 2011, and was followed by a nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The government ordered a mandatory evacuation from the high radioactive concentration area in Fukushima. This evacuation may have forced many evacuees to change specific aspects of their lifestyles such as diet and physical activity, which in turn may lead to future incidence of lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). To address this concern, the association between the evacuation and changes in CVD risk factors before and after the disaster was examined in the Fukushima Health Management Survey. In the present study, we reviewed the results of longitudinal studies in the Fukushima Health Management Survey. The proportion of overweight/obese people and those with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, liver dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and polycythemia increased after the disaster. Furthermore, the evacuation was associated with an increase of these cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, evacuees may be more disposed to CVDs such as myocardial infarction and stroke after the disaster. The prevention of future CVDs among evacuees from Fukushima requires ongoing preventive programs for obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, in collaboration with local governments and communities."
"Although the key contributors of altering neurological function in hepatic encephalopathy are relatively well known, the electrophysiological mechanism of CA1 damage, a key vulnerable area during hyperammonemia, have not yet been defined. Therefore, here we focus on the electrophysiological mechanisms of cognitive impairments following bile duct ligation (BDL). We performed patch-clamp recordings from the CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampus of male Wistar rats, which underwent sham or BDL surgery. A striking electrophysiological change of hippocampal neurons in experimental model of BDL was observed in the present study. Spontaneous firing frequency and rate of action potential (AP) rebound was decreased and afterhyperpolarization amplitude (AHP) was increased significantly in hippocampal cells of BDL animals compared to sham group. Together, the results suggest that altered intrinsic properties of the hippocampal neurons may contribute to the cognitive abnormalities during hepatic encephalopathy (HE), highlighting the electrophysiological mechanisms for providing new treatments against HE."
"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are considered as major public health problems. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of MSDs in Azar cohort population in northwest of Iran. Azar cohort study is a state level of a national cohort project (PERSIAN) which began in 2014. All adults over 35 years old in Khamene city in East Azarbaijan province were recruited for the pilot phase of the Azar cohort. For the purpose of the current study, a total of 952 subjects age range of 35-70 who completed the Community Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic Disease (COPCORD) questionnaire as supplementary were included. 299 subjects had MSDs and were introduced to the rheumatologist, only 237 of them referred for further assessment. 33.4% of subjects had MSDs within the past 7 days. The most frequent complaint was pain and the most common sites of complaints were knee, lumbar spine, and shoulder, respectively. Osteoarthritis was the most common rheumatic disease (53.2%) and the knee was the most common region affected (47.7%) followed by low back pain (28.2%). Osteoarthritis and knee osteoarthritis were present in 56.1 and 51.8% of females and 46.6 and 38.4% of males, respectively. Furthermore, low back pain was present in 32.9% of males and 26.2% of females. Peri-arthritis was more prevalent in males (12.3%), whilst fibromyalgia, psychologic pain, and heel spur were prevalent among females (9.1, 5.1, and 1.2%, respectively). Rheumatoid arthritis was observed in 1.4% of males and 1.8% of females, respectively. Prevalence of MSDs is very high in this area. Therefore, it calls for action by heath officials and professionals to plan for appropriate programs of prevention and management of MSDs in society."
"Hand Eczema (HE) is a dermatological disorder with frequent relapses and multiple causes such as atopic, allergic and irritant contact dermatitis. The management is complex because of the wide range of different pathogenesis. Efficacy of some of available treatments is not well established and it can affect patients' quality of life significantly."
"Nowadays, obesity is considered as a serious and growing global health problem. It is documented that the overweight and obesity are major risk factors for a series of noncommunicable diseases, and in recent years, the obesity-cancer link has received much attention. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is associated with increased risk of several cancer types, including colon, breast, endometrium, liver, kidney, esophagus, gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, and leukemia, and can also lead to poorer treatment. We review here the epidemiological and experimental evidences for the association between obesity and cancer. Specifically, we discuss potential mechanisms focusing how dysfunctional angiogenesis, chronic inflammation, interaction of proinflammatory cytokines, endocrine hormones, and adipokines including leptin, adiponectin insulin, growth factors, estrogen, and progesterone and strikingly, cell metabolism alteration in obesity participate in tumor development and progression, resistance to chemotherapy, and targeted therapies such as antiangiogenic and immune therapies."
"T-cell response outcome is determined by co-stimulatory/inhibitory signals. Programmed cell death-1 ligand-1 (PD-L1) is a member of these co-signaling molecules with known soluble form in human serum. Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) is also recognized in patients with some types of malignancy or autoimmune disorders, though there are few studies on sPD-L1 roles in allergic diseases. The purpose of this survey was to evaluate the association between sPD-L1 levels with eosinophil count as well as disease severity in allergic rhinitis (AR) patients."

"We studied changes in blood markers of 18 nonprofessional, middle-aged runners of a 2-day, 130 km ultramarathon. Blood was sampled at baseline, after the goals on the first and second day, and at three time points (1, 3, and 5/6 days) after the race. Blood indices showed three patterns. First pattern indices showed essentially no changes after the two goals and after the race, including red blood cell indices, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Second pattern markers, including the majority of indices, were elevated during the race (and also after the race for some parameters) and then returned to baseline afterward, including hemolysis/red blood cell destruction markers (indirect bilirubin) and an iron reservoir index (ferritin), muscle damage parameters (uric acid, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase), renal function markers (creatinine and blood urea nitrogen), liver injury index (alanine aminotransferase), lipid metabolism indices (free fatty acid), reactive oxygen species and inflammation parameters (white blood cells, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein), and energy production and catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine). Third pattern index of a lipid metabolism marker - triglyceride - decreased during the race periods and started returning to baseline from then onward. Some hormonal markers such as insulin, leptin, and adiponectin showed unique patterns. These findings appeared informative for nonprofessional athletes to know about an optimal physical activity level, duration, and total exercise for elevating physical performance and monitoring physical/mental conditioning as well as for prevention of overtraining and physical injuries."

"Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are essential unsaturated long-chain FAs necessary for proper health and growth. The objective of the authors in this study was to evaluate the effect of fish oil supplementation in pregnancy on maternal serum FA profiles. Participants (n = 150 pregnant women aged 18-35 years in Tabriz, Iran) were randomly assigned to receive either 1,000 mg fish oil supplements daily containing 120 mg docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), or placebo from week 21 of pregnancy to delivery. The primary outcome measures were mean serum DHA and EPA proportion of total FAs at weeks 35-37 of pregnancy. Analyses were based on intention-to-treat. No significant differences were observed between the groups in consumption of fish and serum FAs levels at baseline. Fish oil supplementation significantly increased the mean DHA proportion of total FAs in the intervention compared to the placebo group at weeks 35-37 [adjusted Mean Difference (aMD) = 0.15; 95% CI 0.08-0.23]. The mean EPA proportion of total FAs also increased in the intervention group, but the difference between the groups was not significant (aMD = 0.04; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.08). The dietary recommendation for consumption of 1,000 mg/day fish oil supplements during pregnancy seems beneficial for better serum FA composition."
"Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a serious complication of solid organ transplantation that occurs due to immunosuppression and other risk factors. PTLD may present with involvement of other organs and with unusual presentation. The presentation is often extranodal (e.g., in the gastrointestinal tract, lung, or the central nervous system). Herein, we report on a 1.5-year-old girl who underwent liver transplantation almost 5 months prior to admission. She was on medications such as tacrolimus and prednisolone. Her presentation was started with symptoms of the upper respiratory infection followed by croupy cough and respiratory distress with no response to usual treatments. She had respiratory arrest during broncoscopy. Therefore, emergency tracheostomy was done. Biopsy from the paratracheal mass revealed large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (PTLD, monomorphic and high grade).

"Socioeconomic inequalities affecting health are of major importance in Europe. The literature enhances the role of social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic characteristics and urbanization, to achieve health equity. Yet, there is still much to know, mainly concerning the association between cause-specific mortality and several social determinants, especially in metropolitan areas. This study aims to describe the geographical pattern of cause-specific mortality in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA), at small area level (parishes), and analyses the statistical association between mortality risk and health determinants (material deprivation and urbanization level). Fourteen causes have been selected, representing almost 60% of total mortality between 1995 and 2008, particularly those associated with urbanization and material deprivation."
"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global public health problem and a major etiology of chronic liver disease, which may develop into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
