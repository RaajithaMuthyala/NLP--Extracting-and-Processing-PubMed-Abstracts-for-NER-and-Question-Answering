"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a prevalent liver condition that can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis. It also poses a risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, underscoring the importance of identifying effective treatments. N-acetylcysteine, an inhibitor of glutathione depletion, shows promise in modulating intracellular glutathione biosynthesis and combating oxidative stress, making it a potentially beneficial therapy for liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This study assesses the impact of N-acetylcysteine on HepG2 cells which were induced into fatty liver cells was evaluated. HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM and seeded onto six-well plates at a density of 5 × 10",Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease prevalent liver condition progress fibrosis cirrhosis also poses risk hepatocellular carcinoma underscoring importance identifying effective treatments Nacetylcysteine inhibitor glutathione depletion shows promise modulating intracellular glutathione biosynthesis combating oxidative stress making potentially beneficial therapy liver fibrosis nonalcoholic fatty liver disease study assesses impact Nacetylcysteine HepG2 cells induced fatty liver cells evaluated HepG2 cells cultured DMEM seeded onto sixwell plates density 5 10

"Coffee, tea and caffeinated foods are popular in the world due to their high amount of caffeine, which are consumed daily by people in large quantities, and their effects on the body, especially the liver, are somewhat unknown, so this study was done with the aim of relationship between coffee and tea consumption and dietary intake of Caffeine on the serum liver enzymes and lipid profile. In this cross-sectional study the information of 8889 participants aged 35-70 years who referred to the Rafsanjan Cohort Study (RCS), a population-based prospective cohort that is a part of the Prospective epidemiological research studies in Iran (PERSIAN), was used. Demographic characteristics, medical history, consumption of coffee and tea, caffeine intake, and laboratory tests were collected. Dichotomous logistics regression models were used using crude and adjusted models to investigate the relationship between coffee, tea consumption, and caffeine intake with liver enzymes and lipid profile. Out of 8889 participants 4678 (52.6%) were female and 4211 (47.4%) were male. In older people, especially men, the consumption of tea and coffee increased and has a direct relationship with the abnormality of total cholesterol (TC) (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.29). Also, it was observed that increased abnormal Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.52) and decreased abnormal serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.46 to 0.93) were significantly associated with a high intake of caffeine. The other variables related to lipid profile and liver enzymes increased with increasing consumption of coffee, tea and intake of caffeine in participants, but did not show a significant increase. A high intake of caffeine and coffee and tea can have adverse effects on some liver enzymes and blood factors. Therefore, care should be taken when using these materials.",Coffee tea caffeinated foods popular world due high amount caffeine consumed daily people large quantities effects body especially liver somewhat unknown study done aim relationship coffee tea consumption dietary intake Caffeine serum liver enzymes lipid profile crosssectional study information 8889 participants aged 3570 years referred Rafsanjan Cohort Study RCS populationbased prospective cohort part Prospective epidemiological research studies Iran PERSIAN used Demographic characteristics medical history consumption coffee tea caffeine intake laboratory tests collected Dichotomous logistics regression models used using crude adjusted models investigate relationship coffee tea consumption caffeine intake liver enzymes lipid profile 8889 participants 4678 526 female 4211 474 male older people especially men consumption tea coffee increased direct relationship abnormality total cholesterol TC 114 95 CI 101 129 Also observed increased abnormal Alkaline phosphatase ALP 122 95 CI 101 152 decreased abnormal serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase SGOT 065 95 CI 046 093 significantly associated high intake caffeine variables related lipid profile liver enzymes increased increasing consumption coffee tea intake caffeine participants show significant increase high intake caffeine coffee tea adverse effects liver enzymes blood factors Therefore care taken using materials
"We investigated California mortality and social determinants of health, as measured by the Healthy Places Index (HPI), which is a composite measure of 23 indicators of neighborhood (census tract) economic conditions, education, transportation, housing, social capital, environmental pollution, built-environment, and access to health care. We aggregated deaths to 2010 census tract boundaries for leading causes, 2015 to 2019, and COVID-19, 2020-2021, from death certificates and populations from the American Community Survey, 2015 to 2019. We age-adjusted and stratified death rates by HPI deciles, age, gender, and race/ethnicity, and examined HPI dose-response with segmental regression. For all causes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, COVID-19, diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, injuries, and Alzheimer's disease (ages 65-74 years), mortality rates were inversely related to HPI decile. For all causes mortality, the rate ratio between the 1st and 10th decile (reference) was 1.63 (CI95%: 1.60-1.66), and, for COVID-19, the rate ratio was 7.61 (CI95%: 7.14-8.12). The population attributable fraction was 24% for all causes and 72% for COVID-19. Age, gender, race/ethnicity modified the steepness and shape of dose-response curves. The findings illustrate opportunities to incorporate area-based socioeconomic measures in routine public health surveillance, and to reinforce policies and programs that reduce health inequities.",investigated California mortality social determinants health measured Healthy Places Index HPI composite measure 23 indicators neighborhood census tract economic conditions education transportation housing social capital environmental pollution builtenvironment access health care aggregated deaths 2010 census tract boundaries leading causes 2015 2019 COVID19 20202021 death certificates populations American Community Survey 2015 2019 ageadjusted stratified death rates HPI deciles age gender raceethnicity examined HPI doseresponse segmental regression causes cancer cardiovascular disease COVID19 diabetes cirrhosis liver injuries Alzheimers disease ages 6574 years mortality rates inversely related HPI decile causes mortality rate ratio 1st 10th decile reference 163 CI95 160166 COVID19 rate ratio 761 CI95 714812 population attributable fraction 24 causes 72 COVID19 Age gender raceethnicity modified steepness shape doseresponse curves findings illustrate opportunities incorporate areabased socioeconomic measures routine public health surveillance reinforce policies programs reduce health inequities

"Liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths, following pancreatic cancer. The 5-year overall survival rate for HCC remains relatively low. Currently, there are multiple treatment options available for HCC, including systemic drugs, minimally invasive local therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), and arterial radioembolization (TARE), as well as surgical interventions like liver resection or transplantation. However, the effectiveness of drug delivery to the cancerous liver is hindered by pathophysiological changes in the organ. In order to address this challenge, lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as promising platforms for delivering a diverse range of therapeutic drugs. LNPs offer various structural configurations that enhance their physical stability and enable them to accommodate different types of cargo with varying mechanical properties and degrees of hydrophobicity. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the current applications of LNPs in the development of anti-HCC therapies. By examining the existing research, we aim to shed light on the potential future directions and advancements in this field.",Liver cancer specifically hepatocellular carcinoma HCC second leading cause cancerrelated deaths following pancreatic cancer 5year overall survival rate HCC remains relatively low Currently multiple treatment options available HCC including systemic drugs minimally invasive local therapies radiofrequency ablation transarterial chemoembolization TACE arterial radioembolization TARE well surgical interventions like liver resection transplantation However effectiveness drug delivery cancerous liver hindered pathophysiological changes organ order address challenge lipidbased nanoparticles LNPs emerged promising platforms delivering diverse range therapeutic drugs LNPs offer various structural configurations enhance physical stability enable accommodate different types cargo varying mechanical properties degrees hydrophobicity article provide comprehensive review current applications LNPs development antiHCC therapies examining existing research aim shed light potential future directions advancements field

"Hepatitis C, caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), is a prevalent liver disease with severe outcomes, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Traditional diagnostic methods primarily detect antiviral antibodies (anti-HCV) or viral RNA, but these approaches have limitations. Anti-HCV antibodies may take 2-4 weeks to develop in acute cases and can be absent in some individuals, leading to undiagnosed early-stage infections. This poses significant challenges for public health, particularly in resource-limited settings where early detection is crucial. This article explores the development of biosensors engineered to directly detect HCV surface antigens, such as envelope proteins. These biosensors provide a promising solution for earlier and more accurate diagnosis by identifying viral components at the initial stages of infection. By focusing on direct detection of viral antigens, these innovations could enhance early diagnosis, facilitate timely intervention, and reduce virus transmission. We evaluate the advancements in biosensor technology over the past decade and their potential to improve HCV detection in clinical and field settings, ultimately supporting global efforts to eliminate HCV as a public health threat.",Hepatitis C caused hepatitis C virus HCV prevalent liver disease severe outcomes including cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma Traditional diagnostic methods primarily detect antiviral antibodies antiHCV viral RNA approaches limitations AntiHCV antibodies may take 24 weeks develop acute cases absent individuals leading undiagnosed earlystage infections poses significant challenges public health particularly resourcelimited settings early detection crucial article explores development biosensors engineered directly detect HCV surface antigens envelope proteins biosensors provide promising solution earlier accurate diagnosis identifying viral components initial stages infection focusing direct detection viral antigens innovations could enhance early diagnosis facilitate timely intervention reduce virus transmission evaluate advancements biosensor technology past decade potential improve HCV detection clinical field settings ultimately supporting global efforts eliminate HCV public health threat

"Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The unclear molecular mechanisms and complex in vivo microenvironment of tumors make it difficult to clarify the nature of cancer and develop effective treatments. Therefore, the development of new methods to effectively treat cancer is urgently needed and of great importance. Organ-on-a-chip (OoC) systems could be the breakthrough technology sought by the pharmaceutical industry to address ever-increasing research and development costs. The past decade has seen significant advances in the spatial modeling of cancer therapeutics related to OoC technology, improving physiological exposition criteria. This article aims to summarize the latest achievements and research results of cancer cell treatment simulated in a 3D microenvironment using OoC technology. To this end, we will first discuss the OoC system in detail and then demonstrate the latest findings of the cancer cell treatment study by Ooc and how this technique can potentially optimize better modeling of the tumor. The prospects of OoC systems in the treatment of cancer cells and their advantages and limitations are also among the other points discussed in this study.",Cancer remains one leading causes death worldwide unclear molecular mechanisms complex vivo microenvironment tumors make difficult clarify nature cancer develop effective treatments Therefore development new methods effectively treat cancer urgently needed great importance Organonachip OoC systems could breakthrough technology sought pharmaceutical industry address everincreasing research development costs past decade seen significant advances spatial modeling cancer therapeutics related OoC technology improving physiological exposition criteria article aims summarize latest achievements research results cancer cell treatment simulated 3D microenvironment using OoC technology end first discuss OoC system detail demonstrate latest findings cancer cell treatment study Ooc technique potentially optimize better modeling tumor prospects OoC systems treatment cancer cells advantages limitations also among points discussed study

"The hip fracture causes significant disabilities in many elderly people. Many studies around the world have identified various risk factors for the hip fracture. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the risk factors of hip fractures. This study is a systematic review of risk factors for hip fractures. All published papers in English and Persian languages on patients in Iran and other countries between 2002 - 2022 were examined. The search strategy used keywords matching the mesh, including : predictors, hip fracture, and disability. Articles were selected from international databases (PubMed, Proquest ,Web of Sience, Scopus, Google scholar and Persian(Sid,Magiran), and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias. The study has identified several factors that were significantly correlated with the risk of hip fracture, including age, cigarette and alcohol consumption, visual and hearing problems, low BMI levels, history of falling, weakness, and diseases such as stroke, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, diabetes, dementia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, liver and kidney diseases, bone density, osteoporosis, vertebral fracture, and hyperthyroidism. However, the study did not find any significant correlations between the consumption of calcium and vitamin D, history of fractures, cognitive disorders, schizophrenia, and household income, and the risk of hip fracture. The results of this study reveal the determining role of some risk factors in hip fracture in older persons. Therefore, it is recommended that health policy makers provide the possibility of early intervention for some changeable factors.",hip fracture causes significant disabilities many elderly people Many studies around world identified various risk factors hip fracture aim study systematically investigate risk factors hip fractures study systematic review risk factors hip fractures published papers English Persian languages patients Iran countries 2002 2022 examined search strategy used keywords matching mesh including predictors hip fracture disability Articles selected international databases PubMed Proquest Web Sience Scopus Google scholar PersianSidMagiran Newcastle Ottawa Scale used assess risk bias study identified several factors significantly correlated risk hip fracture including age cigarette alcohol consumption visual hearing problems low BMI levels history falling weakness diseases stroke cardiovascular disease high blood pressure arthritis diabetes dementia Alzheimers Parkinsons liver kidney diseases bone density osteoporosis vertebral fracture hyperthyroidism However study find significant correlations consumption calcium vitamin history fractures cognitive disorders schizophrenia household income risk hip fracture results study reveal determining role risk factors hip fracture older persons Therefore recommended health policy makers provide possibility early intervention changeable factors

"Smoking is the leading behavioural risk factor for mortality globally, accounting for more than 175 million deaths and nearly 4·30 billion years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2021. The pace of decline in smoking prevalence has slowed in recent years for many countries, and although strategies have recently been proposed to achieve tobacco-free generations, none have been implemented to date. Assessing what could happen if current trends in smoking prevalence persist, and what could happen if additional smoking prevalence reductions occur, is important for communicating the effect of potential smoking policies.",Smoking leading behavioural risk factor mortality globally accounting 175 million deaths nearly 430 billion years life lost YLLs 1990 2021 pace decline smoking prevalence slowed recent years many countries although strategies recently proposed achieve tobaccofree generations none implemented date Assessing could happen current trends smoking prevalence persist could happen additional smoking prevalence reductions occur important communicating effect potential smoking policies
"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic medical condition that affects over 29.5 million people and accounts for $249 billion in social and health care costs annually. Prevalence is higher among young adults, males, sexual and gender minorities, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and the uninsured. Despite its high prevalence and societal impact, AUD is often overlooked in health care settings. This has resulted in insufficient implementation of AUD screening as well as low levels of treatment uptake. Addressing these challenges requires recognition of the current epidemiology of AUD and role of social determinants of health.",Alcohol use disorder AUD chronic medical condition affects 295 million people accounts 249 billion social health care costs annually Prevalence higher among young adults males sexual gender minorities American Indians Alaska Natives uninsured Despite high prevalence societal impact AUD often overlooked health care settings resulted insufficient implementation AUD screening well low levels treatment uptake Addressing challenges requires recognition current epidemiology AUD role social determinants health

"Understanding the association of social determinants of health with liver transplant listing and waitlist outcomes can inform health care policy and interventions aimed at improving access to care. We analyzed the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database merged with the Social Deprivation Index (SDI) to evaluate if the area of residence is associated with the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease incorporating sodium (MELD-Na) at the time of waitlist placement and outcomes following waitlisting, and if this varied based on sociodemographic variables. Compared to candidates residing in areas of low SDI, those residing in areas of high SDI (most socioeconomic disadvantage) had 11% higher adjusted likelihood (aOR [95% CI] = 1.11 [CI 1.05,1.17]) of being listed for transplant with a MELD-Na score ≥30; this was not statistically significant when also adjusted for race/ethnicity (aOR = 1.02 [0.97,1.08]). When stratified by race/ethnicity, residing in an area of high SDI was associated with a MELD-Na score ≥30 at the time of waitlisting among Hispanic White candidates (aOR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.49). Candidates residing in areas of high SDI had an 8% lower chance (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.92 [0.88,0.96]) of undergoing a liver transplant, a 6% higher risk of death (aHR = 1.06 [1.002,1.13]), and a 20% higher risk (aHR = 1.20 [1.13,1.28]) of removal on the waitlist independent of race, ethnicity, insurance status, or sex. In the United States, residence in areas of high socioeconomic disadvantage is significantly associated with higher MELD-Na at the time of waitlisting among Hispanic White candidates. In addition, residence in areas of high socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with a higher risk of death or removal from the waitlist and lower chances of receiving a liver transplant after waitlist placement, particularly among Non-Hispanic White candidates and older candidates.",Understanding association social determinants health liver transplant listing waitlist outcomes inform health care policy interventions aimed improving access care analyzed Scientific Registry Transplant Recipients database merged Social Deprivation Index SDI evaluate area residence associated Model EndStage Liver Disease incorporating sodium MELDNa time waitlist placement outcomes following waitlisting varied based sociodemographic variables Compared candidates residing areas low SDI residing areas high SDI socioeconomic disadvantage 11 higher adjusted likelihood aOR 95 CI 111 CI 105117 listed transplant MELDNa score 30 statistically significant also adjusted raceethnicity aOR 102 097108 stratified raceethnicity residing area high SDI associated MELDNa score 30 time waitlisting among Hispanic White candidates aOR 124 95 CI 104 149 Candidates residing areas high SDI 8 lower chance adjusted hazard ratio aHR 092 088096 undergoing liver transplant 6 higher risk death aHR 106 1002113 20 higher risk aHR 120 113128 removal waitlist independent race ethnicity insurance status sex United States residence areas high socioeconomic disadvantage significantly associated higher MELDNa time waitlisting among Hispanic White candidates addition residence areas high socioeconomic disadvantage associated higher risk death removal waitlist lower chances receiving liver transplant waitlist placement particularly among NonHispanic White candidates older candidates
"As the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases within historically disadvantaged communities, it is imperative to better understand how intersectionality-defined as the complex, cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination (such as racism, sexism, and classism)-intersects and social determinants of health influence the patient's experiences within the medical system when navigating their disease. Culturally sensitive care is characterized by the ability to deliver patient-centered care that recognizes how the intersectionality of an individual's identities impacts their disease journey. An intentional consideration and sensitivity to this impact play important roles in providing an inclusive and welcoming space for historically disadvantaged individuals living with IBD and will help address health inequity in IBD. Cultural competence implies mastery of care that understands and respects values and beliefs across cultures, while cultural humility involves recognizing the complexity of cultural identity and engaging in an ongoing learning process from individual patient experiences. Heightening our patient care goals from cultural competence to cultural sensitivity allows healthcare professionals and the systems in which they practice to lead with cultural humility as they adopt a more inclusive and humble perspective when caring for patient groups with a diverse array of identities and cultures and to avoid maintaining the status quo of implicit and explicit biases that impede the delivery of quality IBD care. In this article, we review the literature on IBD care in historically disadvantaged communities, address culturally sensitive care, and propose a framework to incorporating cultural humility in IBD practices and research.",prevalence inflammatory bowel disease IBD increases within historically disadvantaged communities imperative better understand intersectionalitydefined complex cumulative way effects multiple forms discrimination racism sexism classismintersects social determinants health influence patients experiences within medical system navigating disease Culturally sensitive care characterized ability deliver patientcentered care recognizes intersectionality individuals identities impacts disease journey intentional consideration sensitivity impact play important roles providing inclusive welcoming space historically disadvantaged individuals living IBD help address health inequity IBD Cultural competence implies mastery care understands respects values beliefs across cultures cultural humility involves recognizing complexity cultural identity engaging ongoing learning process individual patient experiences Heightening patient care goals cultural competence cultural sensitivity allows healthcare professionals systems practice lead cultural humility adopt inclusive humble perspective caring patient groups diverse array identities cultures avoid maintaining status quo implicit explicit biases impede delivery quality IBD care article review literature IBD care historically disadvantaged communities address culturally sensitive care propose framework incorporating cultural humility IBD practices research
"Primary liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was the sixth leading cause of cancer death in the United States in 2023. Hispanic people constitute approximately 19% of the nation's total population according to the US Census. Hispanic patients have the highest relative incidence rates of liver cancer compared to non-Hispanic Whites and non-Hispanic Blacks, a disparity frequently overlooked in cancer research. In this study, our primary objective was to analyze the potential underrepresentation of Hispanic individuals in liver cancer research databases. We identified databases that had liver cancer-specific studies and be population-based in the United States. Our search yielded 7 cancer genomic databases, which were analyzed according to incidence percentages across ethnicity and race categories. Our study included 3104 patients; ethnic data was not reported for 13.1% (n = 406) of the patients. Samples were predominantly from individuals who identified as Not Hispanic (81.0%), Hispanic individuals represented 5.9%. Race was reported as follows: non-Hispanic Whites (61.0%), Asians (22.0%), non-Hispanic Blacks (5.4%), Other (3.1%), Native American/American Indian/Alaska Native (0.4%), Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian (0.2%) and not reported (7.9%). These findings collectively underscore significant disparities in the representation of ethnic and racial groups, particularly Hispanics. Given the present racial and ethnic demographics of the US population and the projected surge in the Hispanic population in forthcoming years, it becomes imperative to address health disparities that may worsen without efforts to enhance proper inclusion in cancer research.",Primary liver cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma sixth leading cause cancer death United States 2023 Hispanic people constitute approximately 19 nations total population according US Census Hispanic patients highest relative incidence rates liver cancer compared nonHispanic Whites nonHispanic Blacks disparity frequently overlooked cancer research study primary objective analyze potential underrepresentation Hispanic individuals liver cancer research databases identified databases liver cancerspecific studies populationbased United States search yielded 7 cancer genomic databases analyzed according incidence percentages across ethnicity race categories study included 3104 patients ethnic data reported 131 n 406 patients Samples predominantly individuals identified Hispanic 810 Hispanic individuals represented 59 Race reported follows nonHispanic Whites 610 Asians 220 nonHispanic Blacks 54 31 Native AmericanAmerican IndianAlaska Native 04 Pacific IslanderNative Hawaiian 02 reported 79 findings collectively underscore significant disparities representation ethnic racial groups particularly Hispanics Given present racial ethnic demographics US population projected surge Hispanic population forthcoming years becomes imperative address health disparities may worsen without efforts enhance proper inclusion cancer research
"Social determinants of health, both individual and structural, impact access to liver transplantation (LT). We aimed to evaluate the association between structural social determinants of health (SSDoH) and individual-level psychosocial factors (as measured by the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplant, SIPAT score) on failure to waitlist for LT. We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of 2762 patients evaluated for LT. SSDoH exposures included the Social Deprivation Index (SDI), the proportion of households on cash public assistance or supplemental nutrition assistance (% public assistance), and distance to the transplant center. Neighborhood SDI score in the highest quartile (OR 1.32, 95 % CI 1.07-1.63) and % on public assistance in the highest quartile (OR 1.41, 95 % CI 1.14-1.75) were associated with increased odds of not being waitlisted for LT. These associations remained significant after adjusting for individual psychosocial risk using SIPAT scores (≥21, high psychosocial risk). Highest quartile neighborhood SDI (OR 1.70, 95 % CI 1.13-2.54) and the highest quartile of % on public assistance (OR 1.67, 95 % CI 1.11-2.53) were also associated with increased odds of failure to waitlist for psychosocial reasons. However, these associations were no longer significant after adjusting for individual SIPAT scores. High-risk SIPAT scores were more prevalent in neighborhoods with the highest quartile of SSDoH measures.

Hepatic steatosis is defined by presence of fat in more than 5% of hepatocytes. In hepatocytes, fat is stored as triglycerides in lipid droplet. Hepatic steatosis results from a combination of multiple intracellular processes. In a healthy individual nutrient metabolism is regulated at several steps. It ranges from the selection of nutrients in a grocery store to the last step of consumption of ATP as an energy or as a building block of a cell as structural component. Several hormones, peptides, and genes have been described that participate in nutrient metabolism. Several enzymes participate in each nutrient metabolism as described above from ingestion to generation of ATP. As of now several publications have revealed very intricate regulation of nutrient metabolism, where most of the regulatory factors are tied to each other bidirectionally, making it difficult to comprehend chronological sequence of events. Insulin hormone is the primary regulator of all nutrients' metabolism both in prandial and fasting states. Insulin exerts its effects directly and indirectly on enzymes involved in the three main cellular function processes; metabolic, inflammation and repair, and cell growth and regeneration. Final regulators that control the enzymatic functions through stimulation or suppression of a cell are nuclear receptors in especially farnesoid X receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor/RXR ligands, adiponectin, leptin, and adiponutrin. Insulin hormone has direct effect on these final modulators. Whereas blood glucose level, serum lipids, incretin hormones, bile acids in conjunction with microbiota are intermediary modulators which are controlled by lifestyle. The purpose of this review is to overview the key players in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) that help us understand the disease natural course, risk stratification, role of lifestyle and pharmacotherapy in each individual patient with MASLD to achieve personalized care and target the practice of precision medicine. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were used to identify publication related to metabolism of carbohydrate and fat in states of health and disease states; MASLD, cardiovascular disease and cancer. More than 1000 publications including original research and review papers were reviewed.",Nutrient metabolism regulated several factors Social determinants health without genetics primary regulator metabolism unhealthy lifestyle affects modulators mediators leading adaptation finally exhaustion cellular functions Hepatic steatosis defined presence fat 5 hepatocytes hepatocytes fat stored triglycerides lipid droplet Hepatic steatosis results combination multiple intracellular processes healthy individual nutrient metabolism regulated several steps ranges selection nutrients grocery store last step consumption ATP energy building block cell structural component Several hormones peptides genes described participate nutrient metabolism Several enzymes participate nutrient metabolism described ingestion generation ATP several publications revealed intricate regulation nutrient metabolism regulatory factors tied bidirectionally making difficult comprehend chronological sequence events Insulin hormone primary regulator nutrients metabolism prandial fasting states Insulin exerts effects directly indirectly enzymes involved three main cellular function processes metabolic inflammation repair cell growth regeneration Final regulators control enzymatic functions stimulation suppression cell nuclear receptors especially farnesoid X receptor peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptorRXR ligands adiponectin leptin adiponutrin Insulin hormone direct effect final modulators Whereas blood glucose level serum lipids incretin hormones bile acids conjunction microbiota intermediary modulators controlled lifestyle purpose review overview key players pathogenesis metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatotic liver disease MASLD help us understand disease natural course risk stratification role lifestyle pharmacotherapy individual patient MASLD achieve personalized care target practice precision medicine PubMed Google Scholar databases used identify publication related metabolism carbohydrate fat states health disease states MASLD cardiovascular disease cancer 1000 publications including original research review papers reviewed

"Polyphenols, natural micronutrients derived from plants, are valued for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The escalating global prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) underscores its status as a chronic progressive liver condition. Furthermore, the dysregulation of gut microbiota (GM) is implicated in the onset and progression of NAFLD through the actions of metabolites such as bile acids (BAs), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), choline, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Additionally, GM may influence the integrity of the intestinal barrier. This review aims to evaluate the potential effects of polyphenols on GM and intestinal barrier function, and their subsequent impact on NAFLD. We searched through a wide range of databases, such as Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus to gather information for our non-systematic review of English literature. GM functions and composition can be regulated by polyphenols such as chlorogenic acid, curcumin, green tea catechins, naringenin, quercetin, resveratrol, and sulforaphane. Regulating GM composition improves NAFLD by alleviating inflammation, liver fat accumulation, and liver enzymes. Furthermore, it improves serum lipid profile and gut barrier integrity. All of these components affect NAFLD through the metabolites of GM, including SCFAs, choline, LPS, and BAs. Current evidence indicates that chlorogenic acid, resveratrol, quercetin, and curcumin can modulate GM, improving intestinal barrier integrity and positively impacting NAFLD. More studies are necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of naringenin, sulforaphane, and catechin.",Polyphenols natural micronutrients derived plants valued antiinflammatory antioxidant properties escalating global prevalence nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD underscores status chronic progressive liver condition Furthermore dysregulation gut microbiota GM implicated onset progression NAFLD actions metabolites bile acids BAs lipopolysaccharide LPS choline shortchain fatty acids SCFAs Additionally GM may influence integrity intestinal barrier review aims evaluate potential effects polyphenols GM intestinal barrier function subsequent impact NAFLD searched wide range databases Web Science PubMed EMBASE Scopus gather information nonsystematic review English literature GM functions composition regulated polyphenols chlorogenic acid curcumin green tea catechins naringenin quercetin resveratrol sulforaphane Regulating GM composition improves NAFLD alleviating inflammation liver fat accumulation liver enzymes Furthermore improves serum lipid profile gut barrier integrity components affect NAFLD metabolites GM including SCFAs choline LPS BAs Current evidence indicates chlorogenic acid resveratrol quercetin curcumin modulate GM improving intestinal barrier integrity positively impacting NAFLD studies necessary evaluate safety efficacy naringenin sulforaphane catechin

"Diabetes, a complex multisystem metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, leads to complications that reduce quality of life and increase mortality. Diabetes pathophysiology includes dysfunction of beta cells, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from immune-mediated beta cell destruction. The more prevalent type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by varying degrees of beta cell dysfunction in concert with insulin resistance. The strong association between obesity and T2D involves pathways regulated by the central nervous system governing food intake and energy expenditure, integrating inputs from peripheral organs and the environment. The risk of developing diabetes or its complications represents interactions between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, including the availability of nutritious food and other social determinants of health. This perspective reviews recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of diabetes and its complications, which could alter the course of this prevalent disorder.",Diabetes complex multisystem metabolic disorder characterized hyperglycemia leads complications reduce quality life increase mortality Diabetes pathophysiology includes dysfunction beta cells adipose tissue skeletal muscle liver Type 1 diabetes T1D results immunemediated beta cell destruction prevalent type 2 diabetes T2D heterogeneous disorder characterized varying degrees beta cell dysfunction concert insulin resistance strong association obesity T2D involves pathways regulated central nervous system governing food intake energy expenditure integrating inputs peripheral organs environment risk developing diabetes complications represents interactions genetic susceptibility environmental factors including availability nutritious food social determinants health perspective reviews recent advances understanding pathophysiology treatment diabetes complications could alter course prevalent disorder

"People living with HIV are particularly susceptible to developing metabolic disorders, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and other forms of SLD. However, people living with HIV have been historically excluded from clinical trials and large cohort studies of SLD. Therefore, our understanding of the risk factors and natural history of SLD in this population is poor. Moreover, relevant knowledge gaps on the epidemiology and barriers for adequate health care, such as stigma, hamper adequate responses to the ongoing HIV and SLD syndemic.

"Solid organ transplantation (SOT) is considered the optimal treatment for children with end-stage organ failure; however, increased efforts are needed to understand the gap surrounding equitable access to and health outcomes of SOT for Indigenous children. This scoping review summarizes the literature on the characteristics of access to and health outcomes of pediatric SOT among Indigenous children in the settler-colonial states of Canada, Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia, and the United States. A search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for studies matching preestablished eligibility criteria from inception to November 2021. A preliminary gray literature search was also conducted. Twenty-four studies published between 1996 and 2021 were included. Studies addressed Indigenous pediatric populations within the United States (n = 7), Canada (n = 6), Aotearoa New Zealand (n = 5), Australia (n = 5), and Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia combined (n = 1). Findings showed that Indigenous children experienced longer time on dialysis, lower rates of preemptive and living donor kidney transplantation, and disparities in patient and graft outcomes after kidney transplantation. There were mixed findings about access to liver transplantation for Indigenous children and comparable findings for graft and patient outcomes after liver transplantation. Social determinants of health, such as geographic remoteness, lack of living donors, and traditional spiritual beliefs, may affect SOT access and outcomes for Indigenous children. Evidence gaps emphasize the need for action-based initiatives within SOT that prioritize research with and for Indigenous pediatric populations. Future research should include community-engaged methodologies, situated within local community contexts, to inform culturally safe care for Indigenous children.",Solid organ transplantation SOT considered optimal treatment children endstage organ failure however increased efforts needed understand gap surrounding equitable access health outcomes SOT Indigenous children scoping review summarizes literature characteristics access health outcomes pediatric SOT among Indigenous children settlercolonial states Canada Aotearoa New Zealand Australia United States search performed MEDLINE EMBASE PsycINFO CINAHL studies matching preestablished eligibility criteria inception November 2021 preliminary gray literature search also conducted Twentyfour studies published 1996 2021 included Studies addressed Indigenous pediatric populations within United States n 7 Canada n 6 Aotearoa New Zealand n 5 Australia n 5 Aotearoa New Zealand Australia combined n 1 Findings showed Indigenous children experienced longer time dialysis lower rates preemptive living donor kidney transplantation disparities patient graft outcomes kidney transplantation mixed findings access liver transplantation Indigenous children comparable findings graft patient outcomes liver transplantation Social determinants health geographic remoteness lack living donors traditional spiritual beliefs may affect SOT access outcomes Indigenous children Evidence gaps emphasize need actionbased initiatives within SOT prioritize research Indigenous pediatric populations Future research include communityengaged methodologies situated within local community contexts inform culturally safe care Indigenous children
"The impact of social determinants of health on adult liver transplant recipient outcomes is not clear at a national level. Further understanding of the impact of social determinants of health on patient outcomes can inform effective, equitable health care delivery. Unadjusted and multivariable models were used to analyze the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients to evaluate the association between the Social Deprivation Index (SDI) based on the liver transplant recipient's residential location and patient and graft survival. We included adult recipients between January 1, 2008 and December 1, 2021. Patient and graft survival were lower in adults living in areas with deprivation scores above the median. Five-year patient and graft survival were 78.7% and 76.5%, respectively, in the cohort above median SDI compared to 80.5% and 78.3% below median SDI. Compared to the recipients in low-deprivation residential areas, recipients residing in the highest deprivation (SDI quintile = 5) cohort had 6% higher adjusted risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.13) and 6% higher risk of graft failure (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.001-1.11). The increased risks for recipients residing in more vulnerable residential areas were higher (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.03-1.20 for both death and graft loss) following the first year after transplantation. Importantly, the overall risk for graft loss associated with SDI was not linear but instead accelerated above the median level of deprivation. In the United States, social determinants of health, as reflected by residential distress, significantly impacts 5-year patient and graft survival. The overall effect of residential deprivation modest, and importantly, results illustrate they are more strongly associated with longer-term follow-up and accelerate at higher deprivation levels. Further research is needed to evaluate effective interventions and policies to attenuate disparities in outcomes among recipients in highly disadvantaged areas.",impact social determinants health adult liver transplant recipient outcomes clear national level understanding impact social determinants health patient outcomes inform effective equitable health care delivery Unadjusted multivariable models used analyze Scientific Registry Transplant Recipients evaluate association Social Deprivation Index SDI based liver transplant recipients residential location patient graft survival included adult recipients January 1 2008 December 1 2021 Patient graft survival lower adults living areas deprivation scores median Fiveyear patient graft survival 787 765 respectively cohort median SDI compared 805 783 median SDI Compared recipients lowdeprivation residential areas recipients residing highest deprivation SDI quintile 5 cohort 6 higher adjusted risk mortality adjusted hazard ratio 106 95 CI 101113 6 higher risk graft failure adjusted hazard ratio 106 95 CI 1001111 increased risks recipients residing vulnerable residential areas higher adjusted hazard ratio 111 95 CI 103120 death graft loss following first year transplantation Importantly overall risk graft loss associated SDI linear instead accelerated median level deprivation United States social determinants health reflected residential distress significantly impacts 5year patient graft survival overall effect residential deprivation modest importantly results illustrate strongly associated longerterm followup accelerate higher deprivation levels research needed evaluate effective interventions policies attenuate disparities outcomes among recipients highly disadvantaged areas

"Over the past few years, there has been a progressive increase in premature deaths attributable to suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol-related liver disease that impact life expectancy. Regarding the relationship with contextual effects, the evidence is developing, especially in countries with a peripheral economy, as is the case of Brazil. We carried out an analysis aimed at estimating the relationship between socioeconomic insecurity and deaths due to despair in Brazilian cities. We used 5,570 counties' data to create clusters concerning socioeconomic development and then analyzed age-adjusted mortality rates (ASMR) from each of them and compared them using the ANOVA test. Cluster analysis generated two groups of Brazilian municipalities. DoD rates are consistently higher in the group that experiences more deprivation. However, considering differences between 2010 and 2019, the increase in rates was higher in the group with less deprivation experience (48.82 % vs. 39.53 %) We verified an existing gap between the clusters before the beginning of economic stagnation in 2010 The gap between those two groups decreased from 20.58 % (p < 0.001) in 2010 to 14.03 % in 2019 (p = 0.034). The conjuncture of economic crises creates mortality differentials in certain population groups. Also, significant inequalities explain how causes of death from despair affect different subpopulations. Our first approach assessed this assumption, and we could check those differentials at an ecological level. Public policies should focus on reducing the difference in mortality from despair between higher and lower socioeconomic strata.",past years progressive increase premature deaths attributable suicide drug overdose alcoholrelated liver disease impact life expectancy Regarding relationship contextual effects evidence developing especially countries peripheral economy case Brazil carried analysis aimed estimating relationship socioeconomic insecurity deaths due despair Brazilian cities used 5570 counties data create clusters concerning socioeconomic development analyzed ageadjusted mortality rates ASMR compared using ANOVA test Cluster analysis generated two groups Brazilian municipalities DoD rates consistently higher group experiences deprivation However considering differences 2010 2019 increase rates higher group less deprivation experience 4882 vs 3953 verified existing gap clusters beginning economic stagnation 2010 gap two groups decreased 2058 p 0001 2010 1403 2019 p 0034 conjuncture economic crises creates mortality differentials certain population groups Also significant inequalities explain causes death despair affect different subpopulations first approach assessed assumption could check differentials ecological level Public policies focus reducing difference mortality despair higher lower socioeconomic strata

"Social determinants of health (SDOH) are important predictors of poor clinical outcomes in chronic diseases, but their associations among the general cirrhosis population and liver transplantation (LT) are limited. We conducted a retrospective, multiinstitutional analysis of adult (≥18-years-old) patients with cirrhosis in metropolitan Chicago to determine the associations of poor neighborhood-level SDOH on decompensation complications, mortality, and LT waitlisting. Area deprivation index and covariates extracted from the American Census Survey were aspects of SDOH that were investigated. Among 15 101 patients with cirrhosis, the mean age was 57.2 years; 6414 (42.5%) were women, 6589 (43.6%) were non-Hispanic White, 3652 (24.2%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 2662 (17.6%) were Hispanic. Each quintile increase in area deprivation was associated with poor outcomes in decompensation (sHR [subdistribution hazard ratio] 1.07; 95% CI 1.05-1.10; P < .001), waitlisting (sHR 0.72; 95% CI 0.67-0.76; P < .001), and all-cause mortality (sHR 1.09; 95% CI 1.06-1.12; P < .001). Domains of SDOH associated with a lower likelihood of waitlisting and survival included low income, low education, poor household conditions, and social support (P < .001). Overall, patients with cirrhosis residing in poor neighborhood-level SDOH had higher decompensation, and mortality, and were less likely to be waitlisted for LT. Further exploration of structural barriers toward LT or optimizing health outcomes is warranted.",Social determinants health SDOH important predictors poor clinical outcomes chronic diseases associations among general cirrhosis population liver transplantation LT limited conducted retrospective multiinstitutional analysis adult 18yearsold patients cirrhosis metropolitan Chicago determine associations poor neighborhoodlevel SDOH decompensation complications mortality LT waitlisting Area deprivation index covariates extracted American Census Survey aspects SDOH investigated Among 15 101 patients cirrhosis mean age 572 years 6414 425 women 6589 436 nonHispanic White 3652 242 nonHispanic Black 2662 176 Hispanic quintile increase area deprivation associated poor outcomes decompensation sHR subdistribution hazard ratio 107 95 CI 105110 P 001 waitlisting sHR 072 95 CI 067076 P 001 allcause mortality sHR 109 95 CI 106112 P 001 Domains SDOH associated lower likelihood waitlisting survival included low income low education poor household conditions social support P 001 Overall patients cirrhosis residing poor neighborhoodlevel SDOH higher decompensation mortality less likely waitlisted LT exploration structural barriers toward LT optimizing health outcomes warranted
"Most cancer deaths are related to gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Several environmental and genetic factors are effective in the occurrence of GI cancers, such as esophageal, stomach, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers. In addition to risk factors related to lifestyle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) also play a role in GI cancers, and an increase in the amount of free radicals can lead to oxidative stress and increase the probability of malignancies. NQO1 is part of the body's antioxidant defense system that protects cells against mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. NQO1 is responsible for reducing quinones to hydroquinone and preventing the generation of ROS by catalyzing the reaction. The existence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NADPH Quinone Reductase 1 (NQO1), such as 609C>T NQO1, leads to a decrease in NQO1 enzyme activity. Some NQO1 polymorphisms may increase the risk of gastrointestinal cancer. So, the C609T polymorphism in the NQO1 gene has been found to be effective in causing gastrointestinal cancers. On the other hand, it is very important to know the role of biomarkers in the prognosis and management of cancer treatment. Therefore, this study investigated the role of NQO1 as a biomarker in the management of gastrointestinal cancers (prevention, diagnosis and treatment).",cancer deaths related gastrointestinal GI cancers Several environmental genetic factors effective occurrence GI cancers esophageal stomach colorectal liver pancreatic cancers addition risk factors related lifestyle reactive oxygen species ROS also play role GI cancers increase amount free radicals lead oxidative stress increase probability malignancies NQO1 part bodys antioxidant defense system protects cells mutagenesis carcinogenesis NQO1 responsible reducing quinones hydroquinone preventing generation ROS catalyzing reaction existence single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs NADPH Quinone Reductase 1 NQO1 609CT NQO1 leads decrease NQO1 enzyme activity NQO1 polymorphisms may increase risk gastrointestinal cancer C609T polymorphism NQO1 gene found effective causing gastrointestinal cancers hand important know role biomarkers prognosis management cancer treatment Therefore study investigated role NQO1 biomarker management gastrointestinal cancers prevention diagnosis treatment

"Given the increasing burden of liver cancer in Europe, it is crucial to investigate how social determinants of health (SDoH) affect liver cancer risk factors and access to care in order to improve health outcomes equitably. This paper summarises the available evidence on the differential distribution of liver cancer risk factors, incidence, and health outcomes in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from an SDoH perspective. Vulnerable and marginalised populations have low socio-economic and educational levels and are the most affected by liver cancer risk factors. Reasons for this include varied access to hepatitis B virus vaccination and limited access to viral hepatitis B and C screening, harm reduction, and treatment. Additionally, alcohol-related liver disease remains highly prevalent among individuals with low education, insecure employment, economic instability, migrants, and deprived populations. Moreover, significant variation exists across Europe in the proportion of adults with steatotic liver disease, overweight/obesity, and diabetes, based on geographical area, gender, socio-economic and educational background, and density of ultra-processed food outlets. Inequities in cirrhosis mortality rates have been reported, with the highest death rates among individuals living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas and those with lower educational levels. Furthermore, insufficient healthcare access for key populations with primary liver cancer is influenced by complex healthcare systems, stigmatisation, discrimination, low education, language barriers, and fear of disclosure. These challenges contribute to inequities in liver cancer care pathways. Future studies are needed to explore the different SDoH-interlinked effects on liver cancer incidence and outcomes in European countries. The ultimate goal is to develop evidence-based multilevel public health interventions that reduce the SDoH impact in precipitating and perpetuating the disproportionate burden of liver cancer in specific populations.",Given increasing burden liver cancer Europe crucial investigate social determinants health SDoH affect liver cancer risk factors access care order improve health outcomes equitably paper summarises available evidence differential distribution liver cancer risk factors incidence health outcomes European Economic Area United Kingdom SDoH perspective Vulnerable marginalised populations low socioeconomic educational levels affected liver cancer risk factors Reasons include varied access hepatitis B virus vaccination limited access viral hepatitis B C screening harm reduction treatment Additionally alcoholrelated liver disease remains highly prevalent among individuals low education insecure employment economic instability migrants deprived populations Moreover significant variation exists across Europe proportion adults steatotic liver disease overweightobesity diabetes based geographical area gender socioeconomic educational background density ultraprocessed food outlets Inequities cirrhosis mortality rates reported highest death rates among individuals living socioeconomically disadvantaged areas lower educational levels Furthermore insufficient healthcare access key populations primary liver cancer influenced complex healthcare systems stigmatisation discrimination low education language barriers fear disclosure challenges contribute inequities liver cancer care pathways Future studies needed explore different SDoHinterlinked effects liver cancer incidence outcomes European countries ultimate goal develop evidencebased multilevel public health interventions reduce SDoH impact precipitating perpetuating disproportionate burden liver cancer specific populations

"Social determinants of health are important in designing effective interventions for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This systematic review characterises equity-oriented, social determinants of health-focused HBV interventions, and describes their effectiveness in terms of the prevention, care, or treatment of HBV in high-income countries. We searched electronic databases for central concepts of 'HBV', 'equity', 'social determinants of health', 'intervention', and 'Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries'. Screening and data abstraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. Data were abstracted from 66 studies; articles with a comparative study design (n=36) were included in the narrative synthesis, highlighting social determinants of health domains of interventions, HBV-relevant health outcomes, and extra-health social determinants of health effects (ie, those effects that extend beyond health outcomes). Synthesis aligned with six emergent themes corresponding to HBV prevention and care: knowledge and education, diagnosis and screening, immunisation, care initiation, engagement with clinical care and treatment, and upstream prevention. Studies presented a heterogeneous array of HBV-relevant health outcomes. Most interventions were tailored for social determinants of health domains of race, ethnicity, culture, and language; drug use; and socioeconomic status. Across the themes, at least two-thirds of interventions showed comparative effectiveness for addressing HBV. Extra-health social determinants of health outcomes were observed for two studies. Considerable diversity in population-level approaches was observed regarding intervention goals and effectiveness; most interventions were effective at enhancing the prevention, care, or treatment of HBV.",Social determinants health important designing effective interventions hepatitis B virus HBV infection systematic review characterises equityoriented social determinants healthfocused HBV interventions describes effectiveness terms prevention care treatment HBV highincome countries searched electronic databases central concepts HBV equity social determinants health intervention Organization Economic Cooperation Development OECD countries Screening data abstraction conducted independently two reviewers Data abstracted 66 studies articles comparative study design n36 included narrative synthesis highlighting social determinants health domains interventions HBVrelevant health outcomes extrahealth social determinants health effects ie effects extend beyond health outcomes Synthesis aligned six emergent themes corresponding HBV prevention care knowledge education diagnosis screening immunisation care initiation engagement clinical care treatment upstream prevention Studies presented heterogeneous array HBVrelevant health outcomes interventions tailored social determinants health domains race ethnicity culture language drug use socioeconomic status Across themes least twothirds interventions showed comparative effectiveness addressing HBV Extrahealth social determinants health outcomes observed two studies Considerable diversity populationlevel approaches observed regarding intervention goals effectiveness interventions effective enhancing prevention care treatment HBV
"While the vaccination was introduced as a promising tool to control the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, concerns about vaccine-related side effects had grown. Due to the widespread administration of the COVID-19 vaccine worldwide for the first time, it was necessary to evaluate the safety and potential side effects in recipients. This study aims to assess, the incidence of adverse effects following Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccination and identify their related factors. In this cross-sectional survey-based study, 453 volunteers participated, including 235 men and 218 women. The reported adverse reactions from recipients of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccine were collected by using a questionnaire. The findings showed that the incidence of adverse reactions, such as neurological, systematic, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and local symptoms were significantly higher after the first dose compared to the second dose. Systematic symptoms were the most prevalent reported side effects after the first and second dose injection. The demographical study of participants showed that individuals aged 18-34 and females were more prone to present adverse events following vaccination. However, no significant relationship was found between the occurrence of side effects and the recipients' body mass index. Despite the life-saving role of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, it may have some adverse reactions in recipients. The severity and frequency of side effects were different. So, they were dependent on several factors, including gender and age. Altogether, post-vaccination adverse reactions were mild and tolerable.",vaccination introduced promising tool control Coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic concerns vaccinerelated side effects grown Due widespread administration COVID19 vaccine worldwide first time necessary evaluate safety potential side effects recipients study aims assess incidence adverse effects following OxfordAstraZeneca vaccination identify related factors crosssectional surveybased study 453 volunteers participated including 235 men 218 women reported adverse reactions recipients ChAdOx1 nCoV19 OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine collected using questionnaire findings showed incidence adverse reactions neurological systematic gastrointestinal respiratory local symptoms significantly higher first dose compared second dose Systematic symptoms prevalent reported side effects first second dose injection demographical study participants showed individuals aged 1834 females prone present adverse events following vaccination However significant relationship found occurrence side effects recipients body mass index Despite lifesaving role vaccination SARSCoV2 may adverse reactions recipients severity frequency side effects different dependent several factors including gender age Altogether postvaccination adverse reactions mild tolerable

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a systemic disorder with a complex multifactorial and heterogeneous pathogenesis and has become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in many countries around the world. Numerous studies in Iran have presented different results on the prevalence and risk factors of NAFLD, in this study, which has been done in a systematic review and meta-analysis, provides a good estimate of the prevalence and risk factors of the disease in Iran. Following the peer review of electronic search strategies (PRESS and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses [PRISMA] statement, we searched Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Persian scientific searcher (Elmnet) from inception to September 19, 2022. In the present study, 71 articles were reviewed for qualitative and meta-analysis. The overall mean prevalence of NAFLD in children studies was 22.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.9% to 33.9%). The prevalence was notably higher in adult studies 40.5% (95% CI: 35.1% to 46%). In 24 studies, the association between NAFLD and sex was reported, 10 of which showed significant relationships. Out of 46 studies observed that NAFLD prevalence increased significantly with body mass index (BMI). Eight out of 14 studies reported significant associations between FBS and NAFLD in children's studies.

"Disparities exist in the access to living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in the United States. However, the association of neighborhood-level social determinants of health (SDoH) on the receipt of LDLT is not well-established. This was a retrospective cohort study of adult liver transplant recipients between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2021 at centers performing LDLT using the United Network for Organ Sharing database, which was linked through patients' ZIP code to a set of 24 neighborhood-level SDoH measures from different data sources. Temporal trends and center differences in neighborhood Social Deprivation Index (SDI), a validated scale of socioeconomic deprivation ranging from 0 to 100 (0=least disadvantaged), were assessed by transplant type. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated the association of increasing SDI on receipt of LDLT [vs. deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT)]. There were 51,721 DDLT and 4026 LDLT recipients at 59 LDLT-performing centers during the study period. Of the 24 neighborhood-level SDoH measures studied, the SDI was most different between the 2 transplant types, with LDLT recipients having lower SDI (ie, less socioeconomic disadvantage) than DDLT recipients (median SDI 37 vs. 47; p < 0.001). The median difference in SDI between the LDLT and DDLT groups significantly decreased from 13 in 2005 to 3 in 2021 ( p = 0.003). In the final model, the SDI quintile was independently associated with transplant type ( p < 0.001) with a threshold SDI of ~40, above which increasing SDI was significantly associated with reduced odds of LDLT (vs. reference SDI 1-20). As a neighborhood-level SDoH measure, SDI is useful for evaluating disparities in the context of LDLT. Center outreach efforts that aim to reduce disparities in LDLT could preferentially target US ZIP codes with SDI > 40.",Disparities exist access living donor liver transplantation LDLT United States However association neighborhoodlevel social determinants health SDoH receipt LDLT wellestablished retrospective cohort study adult liver transplant recipients January 1 2005 December 31 2021 centers performing LDLT using United Network Organ Sharing database linked patients ZIP code set 24 neighborhoodlevel SDoH measures different data sources Temporal trends center differences neighborhood Social Deprivation Index SDI validated scale socioeconomic deprivation ranging 0 100 0least disadvantaged assessed transplant type Multivariable logistic regression evaluated association increasing SDI receipt LDLT vs deceased donor liver transplantation DDLT 51721 DDLT 4026 LDLT recipients 59 LDLTperforming centers study period 24 neighborhoodlevel SDoH measures studied SDI different 2 transplant types LDLT recipients lower SDI ie less socioeconomic disadvantage DDLT recipients median SDI 37 vs 47 p 0001 median difference SDI LDLT DDLT groups significantly decreased 13 2005 3 2021 p 0003 final model SDI quintile independently associated transplant type p 0001 threshold SDI 40 increasing SDI significantly associated reduced odds LDLT vs reference SDI 120 neighborhoodlevel SDoH measure SDI useful evaluating disparities context LDLT Center outreach efforts aim reduce disparities LDLT could preferentially target US ZIP codes SDI 40

"Safety-net hospitals (SNHs) and facilities are the cornerstone of healthcare services for the medically underserved. The burden of chronic liver disease-including end-stage manifestations of cirrhosis and liver cancer-is high and rising among populations living in poverty who primarily seek and receive care in safety-net settings. For many reasons related to social determinants of health, these individuals often present with delayed diagnoses and disease presentations, resulting in higher liver-related mortality. With recent state-based policy changes such as Medicaid expansion that impact access to insurance and critical health services, an overview of the body of literature on SNH care for chronic liver disease is timely and informative for the liver disease community. In this narrative review, we discuss controversies in the definition of a SNH and summarize the known disparities in the cascade of the care and management of common liver-related conditions: (1) steatotic liver disease, (2) liver cancer, (3) chronic viral hepatitis, and (4) cirrhosis and liver transplantation. In addition, we review the specific impact of Medicaid expansion on safety-net systems and liver disease outcomes and highlight effective provider- and system-level interventions.

Here, we present the case of an uninsured 49-year-old man with untreated UC who was diagnosed with PSC and subsequently became lost to follow-up. It is critical for providers to identify barriers to acquiring appropriate medical care, such as financial instability and low health literacy, when identifying and treating conditions like PSC.

"Social determinants of health and associated systems, policies, and practices are important drivers of health disparities. American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations in the United States have elevated incidence rates of stomach, liver, and colorectal cancers compared with other racial/ethnic groups. In this study, we examined incidence rates of 3 types of gastrointestinal cancer among non-Hispanic AI/AN (NH-AI/AN) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) populations by geographic region and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) score. Incident cases diagnosed during 2010-2019 were identified from population-based cancer registries linked with the Indian Health Service patient registration databases. Age-adjusted incidence rates (per 100,000 population) for stomach, liver, and colorectal cancers were compared within NH-AI/AN populations and between the NH-AI/AN and NHW populations by SVI score. Rates were higher among NH-AI/AN populations in moderate- and high-SVI-score counties in Alaska, the Southern Plains, and the East than in low-SVI counties. Incidence rates among NH-AI/AN populations were elevated when compared with NHW populations by SVI category. Results indicated that higher social vulnerability may drive elevated cancer incidence among NH-AI/AN populations. Additionally, disparities between NH-AI/AN and NHW populations persist even when accounting for SVI. Exploring social vulnerability can aid in designing more effective interventions to address root causes of cancer disparities among AI/AN populations.",Social determinants health associated systems policies practices important drivers health disparities American Indian Alaska Native AIAN populations United States elevated incidence rates stomach liver colorectal cancers compared racialethnic groups study examined incidence rates 3 types gastrointestinal cancer among nonHispanic AIAN NHAIAN nonHispanic White NHW populations geographic region Social Vulnerability Index SVI score Incident cases diagnosed 20102019 identified populationbased cancer registries linked Indian Health Service patient registration databases Ageadjusted incidence rates per 100000 population stomach liver colorectal cancers compared within NHAIAN populations NHAIAN NHW populations SVI score Rates higher among NHAIAN populations moderate highSVIscore counties Alaska Southern Plains East lowSVI counties Incidence rates among NHAIAN populations elevated compared NHW populations SVI category Results indicated higher social vulnerability may drive elevated cancer incidence among NHAIAN populations Additionally disparities NHAIAN NHW populations persist even accounting SVI Exploring social vulnerability aid designing effective interventions address root causes cancer disparities among AIAN populations

"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent chronic liver disease with a global prevalence, and modulation of ANGPTL8 expression has emerged as a promising predictor of NAFLD susceptibility. This research was conducted to scrutinize ANGPTL8 protein expression in NAFLD patients and elucidate the interplay between ANGPTL8 gene polymorphisms and their lipid profiles, thus shedding new light on the pathophysiology of this complex disease. The study comprised 423 unrelated participants, including 222 healthy controls and 201 individuals with NAFLD, screened using FibroScan/ultrasonography and laboratory tests. The main goal focused on the genotype and allele frequency distribution in the ANGPTL8 gene, specifically analyzing two genetic variations: rs737337 (T/C) and rs2278426 (C/T). The participants diagnosed with NAFLD were slightly younger (P ≥ 0.05) and had a higher body mass index (BMI) than the individuals in the control group. Notably, there was a significant difference in the occurrence of the rs737337 polymorphism between the NAFLD and control groups, with a lower frequency observed in the NAFLD group. Our results indicated that individuals with the TC + CC genotype and C allele of rs737337 (T/C) had a decreased risk of higher levels of ALT and AST. Conversely, those with the CT, CT + TT genotype, and T allele of rs2278426 (C/T) exhibited an increased risk of higher levels of ALT and AST. The results imply that the rs2278426 (C/T) variant of the ANGPTL8 gene is more strongly linked to an increased risk of NAFLD compared to the rs737337 polymorphism. However, additional research is needed to understand the specific molecular mechanisms responsible for the upregulation of ANGPTL8 in individuals with NAFLD.",Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD prevalent chronic liver disease global prevalence modulation ANGPTL8 expression emerged promising predictor NAFLD susceptibility research conducted scrutinize ANGPTL8 protein expression NAFLD patients elucidate interplay ANGPTL8 gene polymorphisms lipid profiles thus shedding new light pathophysiology complex disease study comprised 423 unrelated participants including 222 healthy controls 201 individuals NAFLD screened using FibroScanultrasonography laboratory tests main goal focused genotype allele frequency distribution ANGPTL8 gene specifically analyzing two genetic variations rs737337 TC rs2278426 CT participants diagnosed NAFLD slightly younger P 005 higher body mass index BMI individuals control group Notably significant difference occurrence rs737337 polymorphism NAFLD control groups lower frequency observed NAFLD group results indicated individuals TC CC genotype C allele rs737337 TC decreased risk higher levels ALT AST Conversely CT CT TT genotype allele rs2278426 CT exhibited increased risk higher levels ALT AST results imply rs2278426 CT variant ANGPTL8 gene strongly linked increased risk NAFLD compared rs737337 polymorphism However additional research needed understand specific molecular mechanisms responsible upregulation ANGPTL8 individuals NAFLD

The gut microbiota makes an important contribution to human functional metabolic pathways by contributing enzymes that are not encoded by the human genome, for instance, the breakdown of polysaccharides, polyphenols and vitamins synthesis. TMAO and SCFAs, human gut microbiota compounds, have respective immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory effects. Choline and l-carnitine are abundant in high-fat diets and are transformed into TMA by gut bacteria. The liver's phase of metabolism then changes TMA into TMAO. In turn, TMAO promotes the activation of macrophages, damages vascular endothelium, and results in CVD-however, dysbiosis decreases SCFAs and bile acids, which raises intestinal permeability. Congestion in the portal vein, a drop in cardiac output, a reduction in intestinal perfusion, and intestinal leakage are all caused by heart failure. These factors induce systemic inflammation by increasing intestinal leakage. By raising CRP and pro-inflammatory reactions, human gut dysbiosis and elevated TMAO levels promote the development of arterial plaque, hasten the beginning of atherosclerosis, and raise the risk of CAD. A healthy symbiosis between the gut microbiota and host is a key factor in shaping the biochemical profile of the diet, therefore which are crucial for maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier, growing mucosa, reducing inflammation, and controlling blood pressure.",Cardiovascular disease CVD remains common cause death worldwide become public health concern proven notable risk factors CVD atherosclerosis hypertension diabetes dyslipidemia inflammation genetic defects However research shown correlation metabolic health gut microbiota dietary risk factors gut microbiota makes important contribution human functional metabolic pathways contributing enzymes encoded human genome instance breakdown polysaccharides polyphenols vitamins synthesis TMAO SCFAs human gut microbiota compounds respective immunomodulatory proinflammatory effects Choline lcarnitine abundant highfat diets transformed TMA gut bacteria livers phase metabolism changes TMA TMAO turn TMAO promotes activation macrophages damages vascular endothelium results CVDhowever dysbiosis decreases SCFAs bile acids raises intestinal permeability Congestion portal vein drop cardiac output reduction intestinal perfusion intestinal leakage caused heart failure factors induce systemic inflammation increasing intestinal leakage raising CRP proinflammatory reactions human gut dysbiosis elevated TMAO levels promote development arterial plaque hasten beginning atherosclerosis raise risk CAD healthy symbiosis gut microbiota host key factor shaping biochemical profile diet therefore crucial maintaining intestinal epithelial barrier growing mucosa reducing inflammation controlling blood pressure

"HCC, the most common form of primary liver cancer, is the fastest rising cause of cancer-related death in the United States. HCC disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. A practical framework is needed to organize the complex patient, provider, health system, and societal factors that drive these racial and ethnic disparities. In this narrative review, we adapted and applied the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) Research Framework to the HCC care continuum, as a step toward better understanding and addressing existing HCC-related disparities. We first summarize the literature on HCC-related disparities by race and ethnicity organized by the framework's 5 domains (biological, behavioral, physical/built environment, sociocultural environment, and health care system) and 4 levels (individual, interpersonal, community, and societal) of influence. We then offer strategies to guide future research initiatives toward promotion of health equity in HCC care. Clinicians and researchers may help mitigate further inequities and better address racial and ethnic disparities in HCC care by prioritizing the following in HCC research: (1) increasing racial and ethnic minority representation, (2) collecting and reporting HCC-related data by racial and ethnic subgroups, (3) assessing the patient experience of HCC care by race and ethnicity, and (4) evaluating HCC-specific social determinants of health by race and ethnicity. These 4 priorities will help inform the development of future programs and interventions that are tailored to the unique experiences of each racial and ethnic group.",HCC common form primary liver cancer fastest rising cause cancerrelated death United States HCC disproportionately affects racial ethnic minorities United States practical framework needed organize complex patient provider health system societal factors drive racial ethnic disparities narrative review adapted applied National Institute Minority Health Health Disparities NIMHD Research Framework HCC care continuum step toward better understanding addressing existing HCCrelated disparities first summarize literature HCCrelated disparities race ethnicity organized frameworks 5 domains biological behavioral physicalbuilt environment sociocultural environment health care system 4 levels individual interpersonal community societal influence offer strategies guide future research initiatives toward promotion health equity HCC care Clinicians researchers may help mitigate inequities better address racial ethnic disparities HCC care prioritizing following HCC research 1 increasing racial ethnic minority representation 2 collecting reporting HCCrelated data racial ethnic subgroups 3 assessing patient experience HCC care race ethnicity 4 evaluating HCCspecific social determinants health race ethnicity 4 priorities help inform development future programs interventions tailored unique experiences racial ethnic group

"Oxidative stress has been considered the main contributor to liver injury. Dietary antioxidants would be expected to improve liver function. The hepatoprotective effects of antioxidants are controversial. In the present study, the associations of some dietary antioxidants and the levels of serum liver enzymes were examined. This cross-sectional study was conducted using the Rafsanjan Cohort Study (RCS) data as a population-based prospective cohort which is a part of the Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN (PERSIAN). A total of 9942 participants aged 35-70 years old were included in this study. Among this population, 4631 (46.59%) were male, and 5311 (53.42%) were female. Dietary intakes were collected by a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with 128 items. Aspartate transaminase (AST), Alanine transaminase (ALT), γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured by a biotecnica analyzer. Dichotomous logistics regression models were used to investigate the association between the elevated liver enzymes and intake of dietary antioxidants using crude and adjusted models. In the adjusted model, in subjects with higher consumption of Se, Vit A, Vit E, β-carotene, α-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin, the odds ratios of elevated ALP were decreased compared to the reference group (ORs 0.79 (0.64-0.96), 0.80 (0.66-0.98), 0.73 (0.60-0.89), 0.79 (0.64-0.96), 0.78 (0.64-0.95), 0.80 (0.66-0.98), and 0.79 (0.64-0.98), respectively). Subjects with higher consumption of Se, Vit A, Vit E, and provitamin A carotenoids (β-carotene, α-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin) showed decreased odds of elevated ALP. These findings support the hypothesis that Se, Vit A, Vit E, and provitamin A carotenoids may be associated with improvements in ALP and act as suppressors against the development of liver injury.",Oxidative stress considered main contributor liver injury Dietary antioxidants would expected improve liver function hepatoprotective effects antioxidants controversial present study associations dietary antioxidants levels serum liver enzymes examined crosssectional study conducted using Rafsanjan Cohort Study RCS data populationbased prospective cohort part Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies IrAN PERSIAN total 9942 participants aged 3570 years old included study Among population 4631 4659 male 5311 5342 female Dietary intakes collected validated food frequency questionnaire FFQ 128 items Aspartate transaminase AST Alanine transaminase ALT γglutamyl transferase GGT Alkaline phosphatase ALP measured biotecnica analyzer Dichotomous logistics regression models used investigate association elevated liver enzymes intake dietary antioxidants using crude adjusted models adjusted model subjects higher consumption Se Vit Vit E βcarotene αcarotene βcryptoxanthin odds ratios elevated ALP decreased compared reference group ORs 079 064096 080 066098 073 060089 079 064096 078 064095 080 066098 079 064098 respectively Subjects higher consumption Se Vit Vit E provitamin carotenoids βcarotene αcarotene βcryptoxanthin showed decreased odds elevated ALP findings support hypothesis Se Vit Vit E provitamin carotenoids may associated improvements ALP act suppressors development liver injury

"Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currently the recommended procedure for axillary staging in clinically node-negative early breast cancer at diagnosis. The present study aimed to identify Cytokeratin-19 (CK19) gene profiles that accurately predicted the outcome of breast cancer patients. Fifty tumor samples from breast cancer patients were analyzed for the expression of the CK19 gene using quantitative PCR. Also, normal breast tissues (N = 50) were taken from the same patients that had undergone partial or total mastectomy. This gene signature was confirmed based on tumor's stage, grade, and estrogen receptor (ER) status, using conditional logistic regression. Based on these findings, the negative reported lymph nodes for metastasis had micrometastasis in significant values. There was a significant difference between normal and cancer samples in  CK19 expression.

"Overlap syndrome (OS) is a term that comprises the presentation of multiple hepatic disease characteristics in the same patient, such as the presence of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) features in addition to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Standard therapy for AIH is immunosuppression, while ursodeoxycholic acid is the preferred treatment for PBC. Additionally, liver transplantation (LT) may be considered in severe cases. Hispanics have been found to have a higher prevalence of chronic liver disease and develop more complications associated with portal hypertension at the time of listing for LT. Despite being the fastest-growing population in the USA, Hispanics have a higher probability of not receiving an LT due to issues with social determinants of health (SDOH). It has been reported that Hispanics are more likely to be removed from the transplant list. We report a case of a 25-year-old female immigrant from a Latin American developing country who presented with symptoms consistent with worsening liver disease after years of inappropriate workup and late diagnosis due to barriers within the healthcare system. The patient had a history of unresolved jaundice and pruritus and presented with worsening of her previous symptoms and new onset abdominal distention, bilateral leg edema, and telangiectasias. Laboratory and imaging studies confirmed the diagnosis of AIH and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC-AIH syndrome). The patient was started on steroids, azathioprine, and ursodeoxycholic acid, showing improvement. Due to her migratory status, she could not receive an appropriate diagnosis and follow up with a single provider or healthcare institution, putting her at increased risk for life-threatening complications. Although medical management is the first step, the probability of future liver transplants exists. The patient is still undergoing liver transplant evaluation and completing a workup since she was found to have an elevated model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Even with the introduction of new scores and policies that aim to reduce disparities in LT, Hispanic patients are still at higher risk of being removed from the waitlist because of death or clinical deterioration compared to non-Hispanics. To this day, Hispanics have the highest percentage of waitlist deaths (20.8%) of all ethnicities and the lowest overall rate for undergoing LT. Understanding and addressing the causes that could contribute to and explain this phenomenon is essential. Increasing awareness of this problem is vital to promote more research on LT disparities.",Overlap syndrome OS term comprises presentation multiple hepatic disease characteristics patient presence autoimmune hepatitis AIH features addition primary sclerosing cholangitis PSC primary biliary cholangitis PBC Standard therapy AIH immunosuppression ursodeoxycholic acid preferred treatment PBC Additionally liver transplantation LT may considered severe cases Hispanics found higher prevalence chronic liver disease develop complications associated portal hypertension time listing LT Despite fastestgrowing population USA Hispanics higher probability receiving LT due issues social determinants health SDOH reported Hispanics likely removed transplant list report case 25yearold female immigrant Latin American developing country presented symptoms consistent worsening liver disease years inappropriate workup late diagnosis due barriers within healthcare system patient history unresolved jaundice pruritus presented worsening previous symptoms new onset abdominal distention bilateral leg edema telangiectasias Laboratory imaging studies confirmed diagnosis AIH primary sclerosing cholangitis PSCAIH syndrome patient started steroids azathioprine ursodeoxycholic acid showing improvement Due migratory status could receive appropriate diagnosis follow single provider healthcare institution putting increased risk lifethreatening complications Although medical management first step probability future liver transplants exists patient still undergoing liver transplant evaluation completing workup since found elevated model endstage liver disease MELD score Even introduction new scores policies aim reduce disparities LT Hispanic patients still higher risk removed waitlist death clinical deterioration compared nonHispanics day Hispanics highest percentage waitlist deaths 208 ethnicities lowest overall rate undergoing LT Understanding addressing causes could contribute explain phenomenon essential Increasing awareness problem vital promote research LT disparities
"As regards colorectal cancer (CRC) in France, social inequalities in health (SIH) exist. Underprivileged patients are characterized by reduced incidence of CRC and, conversely, by excess mortality. The explanatory mechanisms of the SIHs influencing survival are complex, multidimensional and variable according to healthcare system. Among the most deprived compared to the least deprived patients, SIHs are reflected by lower participation in screening campaigns, and CRC diagnosis is more frequently given at a later stage in an emergency context. During treatment, disadvantaged patients are more at risk of having to undergo open surgery and of enduring severe postoperative complications and belated chemotherapy (when recommended). Study of SIHs poses unusual challenges, as it is necessary not only to pinpoint social deprivation, but also to locate the different treatment facilities existing in a given territorial expanse. In the absence of individualized socioeconomic information, research in France on the social determinants of health is based on duly constituted cancer registries, in which an ecological index of social deprivation, the European Deprivation Index (EDI), provides an aggregate measure of the socioeconomic environment of a given individual in a given geographical setting at a given point in time. All in all, studies on SIHs are justified as means of identification and comprehension of the mechanisms underlying social deprivation, the objective being to more precisely orient programs and practices aimed at combating SIH.",regards colorectal cancer CRC France social inequalities health SIH exist Underprivileged patients characterized reduced incidence CRC conversely excess mortality explanatory mechanisms SIHs influencing survival complex multidimensional variable according healthcare system Among deprived compared least deprived patients SIHs reflected lower participation screening campaigns CRC diagnosis frequently given later stage emergency context treatment disadvantaged patients risk undergo open surgery enduring severe postoperative complications belated chemotherapy recommended Study SIHs poses unusual challenges necessary pinpoint social deprivation also locate different treatment facilities existing given territorial expanse absence individualized socioeconomic information research France social determinants health based duly constituted cancer registries ecological index social deprivation European Deprivation Index EDI provides aggregate measure socioeconomic environment given individual given geographical setting given point time studies SIHs justified means identification comprehension mechanisms underlying social deprivation objective precisely orient programs practices aimed combating SIH
"There are well-described racial and ethnic disparities in the burden of chronic liver diseases. Hispanic persons are at highest risk for developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the fastest growing cause of liver disease. Hepatitis B disproportionately affects persons of Asian or African descent. The highest rates of hepatitis C occur in American Indian and Alaskan Native populations. In addition to disparities in disease burden, there are also marked racial and ethnic disparities in access to treatments, including liver transplantation. Disparities also exist by gender and geography, especially in alcohol-related liver disease. To achieve health equity, we must address the root causes that drive these inequities. Understanding the role that social determinants of health play in the disparate health outcomes that are currently observed is critically important. We must forge and/or strengthen collaborations between patients, community members, other key stakeholders, health care providers, health care institutions, professional societies, and legislative bodies. Herein, we provide a high-level review of current disparities in chronic liver disease and describe actionable strategies that have potential to bridge gaps, improve quality, and promote equity in liver care.",welldescribed racial ethnic disparities burden chronic liver diseases Hispanic persons highest risk developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fastest growing cause liver disease Hepatitis B disproportionately affects persons Asian African descent highest rates hepatitis C occur American Indian Alaskan Native populations addition disparities disease burden also marked racial ethnic disparities access treatments including liver transplantation Disparities also exist gender geography especially alcoholrelated liver disease achieve health equity must address root causes drive inequities Understanding role social determinants health play disparate health outcomes currently observed critically important must forge andor strengthen collaborations patients community members key stakeholders health care providers health care institutions professional societies legislative bodies Herein provide highlevel review current disparities chronic liver disease describe actionable strategies potential bridge gaps improve quality promote equity liver care
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly prevalent in Asians and Pacific Islanders (API) but this heterogenous group is often aggregated into a single category, despite vast differences in culture, socioeconomic status, education, and access to care among subgroups. There remains a significant knowledge gap in HCC outcomes among different subgroups of API. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was accessed, and site/ICD codes were used to identify HCC patients during 2010-2019 who were API ethnicity. Data collected: demographics, socioeconomic status, tumor characteristics, treatment, and survival. Subgroup analyses were performed among different Asian ethnicities in a secondary analysis. 8,249 patients were identified/subdivided into subgroups of Asian ethnicities and Other Pacific Islanders (NHOPI) groups. The median age was 65 years for Asians and 62 years for NHOPI (p < 0.01), and significant differences were found in income (p < 0.01). A higher proportion of NHOPI lived in rural areas compared to Asians (8.1 vs. 1.1%, p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences in tumor size, stage, pre-treatment AFP level, or surgical treatments between the two groups. However, Asians had higher overall median survival than NHOPI (20 months v 12 months, p < 0.01). Secondary analyses among different subgroups of Asian ethnicities revealed significant differences in tumor size and staging, surgical resection, transplant rates, and median survival. While API had similar tumor characteristics and treatment, Asians had much higher survival than NHOPI. Socioeconomic differences and access to care may contribute to these differences.

"Hepatitis B is a chronic condition, primarily associated with hepatitis B viral infection in early life. The failure of prevention and appropriate management can lead to subsequent liver cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis B most commonly affects people born in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa and their global diasporas. The physical, psychological, and social impacts of hepatitis B are strongly influenced by sex and gender. Inequities in access to timely, sensitive diagnosis and effective management arise from interactions between structural inequalities related to race, ethnicity, Indigenous/settler status, class, and geography. The biomedical response to hepatitis B has led to advances in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, but many affected communities have explanatory health belief models that differ from that of biomedicine. We argue that an intersectional approach, led by affected people and communities, can integrate biomedicine with the lived experience and social context that give purpose to and shape all personal, communal, clinical, and public health responses to hepatitis B. This approach has the potential to enable a consciously equitable, effective response to the biopsychosocial complexities of hepatitis B, improve the health and wellbeing of people living with hepatitis B, and reduce hepatitis B-associated mortality.",Hepatitis B chronic condition primarily associated hepatitis B viral infection early life failure prevention appropriate management lead subsequent liver cirrhosis cancer Hepatitis B commonly affects people born Asia SubSaharan Africa global diasporas physical psychological social impacts hepatitis B strongly influenced sex gender Inequities access timely sensitive diagnosis effective management arise interactions structural inequalities related race ethnicity Indigenoussettler status class geography biomedical response hepatitis B led advances prevention diagnosis treatment many affected communities explanatory health belief models differ biomedicine argue intersectional approach led affected people communities integrate biomedicine lived experience social context give purpose shape personal communal clinical public health responses hepatitis B approach potential enable consciously equitable effective response biopsychosocial complexities hepatitis B improve health wellbeing people living hepatitis B reduce hepatitis Bassociated mortality
"Disparities exist in referral and access to the liver transplant (LT) waitlist, and social determinants of health (SDOH) are increasingly recognized as important factors driving health inequities, including in LT. The SDOH of potential transplant candidates is therefore important to characterize when designing targeted interventions to promote equity in access to LT. Yet, it is uncertain how a transplant center should approach this issue, characterize SDOH, identify disparities, and use these data to inform interventions. We performed a retrospective study of referrals for first-time, single-organ LT to our center from 2016 to 2020. Addresses were geoprocessed and mapped to the corresponding county, census tract, and census block group to assess their geospatial distribution, identify potential disparities in referrals, and characterize their communities across multiple domains of SDOH to identify potential barriers to evaluation and selection. We identified variability in referral patterns and areas with disproportionately low referrals, including counties in the highest quartile of liver disease mortality (9%) and neighborhoods in the highest quintile of socioeconomic deprivation (17%) and quartile of poverty (21%). Black individuals were also under-represented compared with expected state demographics (12% vs. 18%). Among the referral population, several potential barriers to evaluation and selection for LT were identified, including poverty, educational attainment, access to healthy food, and access to technology. This approach to the characterization of a transplant center's referral population by geographic location and associated SDOH demonstrates a model for identifying disparities in a referral population and potential barriers to evaluation that can be used to inform targeted interventions for disparities in LT access.",Disparities exist referral access liver transplant LT waitlist social determinants health SDOH increasingly recognized important factors driving health inequities including LT SDOH potential transplant candidates therefore important characterize designing targeted interventions promote equity access LT Yet uncertain transplant center approach issue characterize SDOH identify disparities use data inform interventions performed retrospective study referrals firsttime singleorgan LT center 2016 2020 Addresses geoprocessed mapped corresponding county census tract census block group assess geospatial distribution identify potential disparities referrals characterize communities across multiple domains SDOH identify potential barriers evaluation selection identified variability referral patterns areas disproportionately low referrals including counties highest quartile liver disease mortality 9 neighborhoods highest quintile socioeconomic deprivation 17 quartile poverty 21 Black individuals also underrepresented compared expected state demographics 12 vs 18 Among referral population several potential barriers evaluation selection LT identified including poverty educational attainment access healthy food access technology approach characterization transplant centers referral population geographic location associated SDOH demonstrates model identifying disparities referral population potential barriers evaluation used inform targeted interventions disparities LT access

"Our investigation aimed at evaluating the relationship between metabolic syndrome, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the Rafsanjan cohort study (RCS). We used data obtained from the RCS, as a part of the prospective epidemiological research studies in Iran. In this cross-sectional research, 9895 participants from the baseline phase of RCS who completed medical questionnaire were included. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) defined using NCEP-ATP III criteria. The relationship between elevated serum liver enzymes levels even within the normal range and metabolic syndrome was evaluated by logistic regressions. The prevalence of MetS was 34.42% in the participants of study. The mean concentrations of AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT increased with increasing MetS components. After adjusting for all potential confounders, elevated serum concentrations of ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP even within the normal range were related with an increased odds of MetS. MetS was associated with increased levels of liver enzymes even within the normal range.

"As the incidence of deaths from external causes including poisonings, suicide, and alcohol-related liver disease, increases in countries such as the United States and Canada, a better understanding of the fundamental social determinants of the substance use underlying these so-called ""deaths of despair"", at the population level, is needed. Using data from the nationally representative data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2003, 2015-2016, 2018 cycles) (N = 30,729), the independent associations between age, sex, marital status, immigrant status, race/ethnicity, education, income, rurality, affective health and the use of illicit substances, opioids (without distinction for prescription status), problematic levels of alcohol, and combined past-year use (≥2) of substances, were explored using multivariate logistic regression, marginal risk, and population attributable fraction estimation, with propensity score-adjusted sensitivity analyses. Males, those who were under 29 years, without a partner, born in Canada, White, or had an affective disorder reported both higher use of individual substances and multiple substances in the past year. Social determinants appear to explain a substantial proportion of substance use patterns overall. Between 10% and 45% of illicit substance, problematic alcohol, and polysubstance use prevalence was attributable to non-partnered marital status, non-immigrant status, and White race/ethnicity. Of opioid use prevalence, 25% was attributable to White race/ethnicity, 13% to affective disorder status and 4% to lower-income. Though not all substance use will result in substance-related morbidity or mortality, these findings highlight the role of social determinants in shaping the intermediary behavioural outcomes that shape population-level risk of ""deaths of despair"".",incidence deaths external causes including poisonings suicide alcoholrelated liver disease increases countries United States Canada better understanding fundamental social determinants substance use underlying socalled deaths despair population level needed Using data nationally representative data Canadian Community Health Survey 2003 20152016 2018 cycles N 30729 independent associations age sex marital status immigrant status raceethnicity education income rurality affective health use illicit substances opioids without distinction prescription status problematic levels alcohol combined pastyear use 2 substances explored using multivariate logistic regression marginal risk population attributable fraction estimation propensity scoreadjusted sensitivity analyses Males 29 years without partner born Canada White affective disorder reported higher use individual substances multiple substances past year Social determinants appear explain substantial proportion substance use patterns overall 10 45 illicit substance problematic alcohol polysubstance use prevalence attributable nonpartnered marital status nonimmigrant status White raceethnicity opioid use prevalence 25 attributable White raceethnicity 13 affective disorder status 4 lowerincome Though substance use result substancerelated morbidity mortality findings highlight role social determinants shaping intermediary behavioural outcomes shape populationlevel risk deaths despair

"Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathology of thyroid disorders. This study examined the effect of gallic acid (GA) on the oxidative status and expression of liver antioxidant genes including thioredoxin (TXN1 & TXN2) and thioredoxin reductase1 (TXNRd1) in hypo- and hyperthyroid rat models. Forty-nine male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into seven groups as follows: control group, hypothyroid and hyperthyroid groups respectively induced by propylthiouracil and levothyroxine, hypo- and hyper thyroid-treated groups (where the groups were separately treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg of GA daily, orally). The levels of thyroid hormones and serum oxidative stress markers were evaluated after 5 weeks. The relative expression of TXN1,2 and TXNRd1 genes was measured via real-time qRT-PCR. The mean level of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde, and uric acid index diminished in the hypothyroid group. Increased TAC reached almost the level of control in hypothyroid groups treated with GA.

"Opium use was recently classified as a human carcinogen for lung cancer by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. We conducted a large, multicenter case-control study evaluating the association between opium use and the risk of lung cancer. We recruited 627 cases and 3477 controls from May 2017 to July 2020. We used unconditional logistic regression analyses to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and measured the association between opium use and the risk of lung cancer. The ORs were adjusted for the residential place, age, gender, socioeconomic status, cigarettes, and water pipe smoking. We found a 3.6-fold risk of lung cancer for regular opium users compared to never users (95% CI: 2.9, 4.6). There was a strong dose-response association between a cumulative count of opium use and lung cancer risk. The OR for regular opium use was higher for small cell carcinoma than in other histology (8.3, 95% CI: 4.8, 14.4). The OR of developing lung cancer among opium users was higher in females (7.4, 95% CI: 3.8, 14.5) than in males (3.3, 95% CI: 2.6, 4.2). The OR for users of both opium and tobacco was 13.4 (95% CI: 10.2, 17.7) compared to nonusers of anything.

"The syndemic of hazardous alcohol consumption, opioid use, and obesity has led to important changes in liver disease epidemiology that have exacerbated health disparities. Health disparities occur when plausibly avoidable health differences are experienced by socially disadvantaged populations. Highlighting health disparities, their sources, and consequences in chronic liver disease is fundamental to improving liver health outcomes. There have been large increases in alcohol use disorder in women, racial and ethnic minorities, and those experiencing poverty in the context of poor access to alcohol treatment, leading to increasing rates of alcohol-associated liver diseases. Rising rates of NAFLD and associated fibrosis have been observed in Hispanic persons, women aged > 50, and individuals experiencing food insecurity. Access to viral hepatitis screening and linkage to treatment are suboptimal for racial and ethnic minorities and individuals who are uninsured or underinsured, resulting in greater liver-related mortality and later-stage diagnoses of HCC. Data from more diverse cohorts on autoimmune and cholestatic liver diseases are lacking, supporting the need to study the contemporary epidemiology of these disorders in greater detail. Herein, we review the existing literature on racial and ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic disparities in chronic liver diseases using a social determinants of health framework to better understand how social and structural factors cause health disparities and affect chronic liver disease outcomes. We also propose potential solutions to eliminate disparities, outlining health-policy, health-system, community, and individual solutions to promote equity and improve health outcomes.",syndemic hazardous alcohol consumption opioid use obesity led important changes liver disease epidemiology exacerbated health disparities Health disparities occur plausibly avoidable health differences experienced socially disadvantaged populations Highlighting health disparities sources consequences chronic liver disease fundamental improving liver health outcomes large increases alcohol use disorder women racial ethnic minorities experiencing poverty context poor access alcohol treatment leading increasing rates alcoholassociated liver diseases Rising rates NAFLD associated fibrosis observed Hispanic persons women aged 50 individuals experiencing food insecurity Access viral hepatitis screening linkage treatment suboptimal racial ethnic minorities individuals uninsured underinsured resulting greater liverrelated mortality laterstage diagnoses HCC Data diverse cohorts autoimmune cholestatic liver diseases lacking supporting need study contemporary epidemiology disorders greater detail Herein review existing literature racial ethnic gender socioeconomic disparities chronic liver diseases using social determinants health framework better understand social structural factors cause health disparities affect chronic liver disease outcomes also propose potential solutions eliminate disparities outlining healthpolicy healthsystem community individual solutions promote equity improve health outcomes

"Background Liver transplantation is the life-saving standard of care for those with end-stage liver disease. Unfortunately, many patients on the liver transplant list die waiting. Several studies have demonstrated significant differences based on disparities in race, gender, and multiple socioeconomic factors. We sought to evaluate recent disparities among patients receiving liver transplants using the latest available data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), the largest publicly available inpatient care database in the United States. Methods We performed an analysis of discharge data from the NIS between 2016 and 2019. We identified adult patients with chronic liver disease who underwent a liver transplant using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for differences in race, gender, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities among those who received a liver transplant. Results A total of 24,595 liver transplants were performed over the study period. Female gender was independently associated with decreased transplant rates (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78-0.89, P < 0.001). Compared to White patients, Black patients had decreased transplant rates (AOR 0.86, 95% CI, 0.75-0.99, P = 0.034), as did Native Americans (AOR 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.97, P = 0.035). Hispanics and Asian Americans had increased rates of liver transplantation (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.32, P = 0.022, and 1.36, 95% CI 1.11-1.67, P = 0.003; respectively). The increase in income quartile was associated with an incremental increase in transplant rates. Additionally, patients with private insurance had much higher transplant rates compared to those with Medicare (AOR 2.50, 95% CI 2.31-2.70, P < 0.001) while patients without insurance had the lowest rates of transplantation (AOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12-0.28, P < 0.001). Conclusions Our analysis demonstrates that race, gender, and other social determinants of health have significant impacts on the likelihood of receiving a liver transplant. Our study, on a national level, confirms previously described disparities in receiving liver transplantation. Patient-level studies are needed to better understand how these variables translate into differing liver transplantation rates.",Background Liver transplantation lifesaving standard care endstage liver disease Unfortunately many patients liver transplant list die waiting Several studies demonstrated significant differences based disparities race gender multiple socioeconomic factors sought evaluate recent disparities among patients receiving liver transplants using latest available data National Inpatient Sample NIS largest publicly available inpatient care database United States Methods performed analysis discharge data NIS 2016 2019 identified adult patients chronic liver disease underwent liver transplant using International Classification Diseases 10th revision ICD10 codes Multivariate logistic regression used adjust differences race gender socioeconomic status comorbidities among received liver transplant Results total 24595 liver transplants performed study period Female gender independently associated decreased transplant rates adjusted odds ratio AOR 083 95 confidence interval CI 078089 P 0001 Compared White patients Black patients decreased transplant rates AOR 086 95 CI 075099 P 0034 Native Americans AOR 064 95 CI 042097 P 0035 Hispanics Asian Americans increased rates liver transplantation AOR 116 95 CI 102132 P 0022 136 95 CI 111167 P 0003 respectively increase income quartile associated incremental increase transplant rates Additionally patients private insurance much higher transplant rates compared Medicare AOR 250 95 CI 231270 P 0001 patients without insurance lowest rates transplantation AOR 018 95 CI 012028 P 0001 Conclusions analysis demonstrates race gender social determinants health significant impacts likelihood receiving liver transplant study national level confirms previously described disparities receiving liver transplantation Patientlevel studies needed better understand variables translate differing liver transplantation rates

"We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the role of serum levels of CA125 and HE4 in predicting optimal cytoreductive surgery. Eligible women who had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer based on both clinical and imaging criteria were enrolled in this study. Serum levels of CA 125 and HE4 were checked before surgery and all patients underwent complete surgical staging. After completion of the pathological evaluation, data were entered in SPSS version 23. One hundred and ten individuals were enrolled in our study. We divided cases between two groups: stage I to III b and stage IIIc to IV. Serum level of HE4 >170 pmol/L can predict optimal cytoreductive surgery before operation. (sensitivity:80% and specificity 70%) and serum level of CA 125 > 320 UI/mL can predict optimal cytoreductive surgery before operation. (sensitivity:80% and specificity 70%). Our data demonstrated a negative predictive value of about 80% for both HE4 and CA125. Based on these cut-off, unnecessary surgery can be avoided in many cases, however, it is unwise to ignore clinical performance and radiological findings. Nevertheless, we can say the evaluation of tumor markers is feasible and helpful in predicting optimal surgery.",conducted crosssectional study evaluate role serum levels CA125 HE4 predicting optimal cytoreductive surgery Eligible women diagnosed ovarian cancer based clinical imaging criteria enrolled study Serum levels CA 125 HE4 checked surgery patients underwent complete surgical staging completion pathological evaluation data entered SPSS version 23 One hundred ten individuals enrolled study divided cases two groups stage III b stage IIIc IV Serum level HE4 170 pmolL predict optimal cytoreductive surgery operation sensitivity80 specificity 70 serum level CA 125 320 UImL predict optimal cytoreductive surgery operation sensitivity80 specificity 70 data demonstrated negative predictive value 80 HE4 CA125 Based cutoff unnecessary surgery avoided many cases however unwise ignore clinical performance radiological findings Nevertheless say evaluation tumor markers feasible helpful predicting optimal surgery

"Filipino Americans (FAs) are the third-largest Asian American subgroup in the United States (US). Some studies showed that FAs experience more cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) than other Asian subgroups and non-Hispanic Whites. The increased prevalence of CMD observed in FAs could be due to genetics and social/dietary lifestyles. While FAs are ascribed as an Asian group, they have higher burdens of CMD, and adverse social determinants of health compared to other Asian subgroups. Therefore, studies to elucidate how FAs might develop CMD and respond to medications used to manage CMD are warranted. The ultimate goals of this study are to identify potential mechanisms for reducing CMD burden in FAs and to optimize therapeutic drug selection.

"It has been over 50 years since the Stonewall Inn Riots in June 1969, a seminal event for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and other sexual and gender-diverse minorities (LGBTQI+, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and everyone else) rights movement. However, sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals still face discrimination and harassment due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. As such, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities has identified SGM communities as a ""health disparity population."" Broadly, there are higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, substance use and abuse, mental health conditions, obesity and eating disorders, certain cancers (breast, cervical, and anorectal), and cardiovascular disease in SGM communities. Transgender patients, especially those of color, are more likely to be uninsured, experience discrimination, and be denied health care than cisgender patients. In addition, SGM individuals have twice the risk of lifetime exposure to emotional, physical, and sexual trauma compared with heterosexuals.

"Liver cancer is a highly fatal condition disproportionately impacting American Indian populations. A thorough understanding of the existing literature is needed to inform region-specific liver cancer prevention efforts for American Indian people. This integrative review explores extant literature relevant to liver cancer in American Indian populations in Arizona and identifies factors of structural inequality affecting these groups. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines informed the methodology, and a literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycInfo for articles including Arizona American Indian adults and liver disease outcomes. Seven articles met the inclusion criteria in the final review. Five of the studies used an observational study design with secondary analysis. One article used a quasiexperimental approach, and another employed a community-engagement method resulting in policy change. The results revealed a lack of empirical evidence on liver cancer prevention, treatment, and health interventions for American Indian populations in Arizona.

"Aflatoxin is one of the dangerous fungal toxins that is produced in the presence of humidity and heat and lack of proper storage conditions and is considered as a dangerous substance threatening human health. The work aimed to determination of aflatoxin M1 (AFM) level in raw, pasteurized, and sterilized milks offered in the study area and to evaluate the risk of its consumption. In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 60 samples of milk types supplied in the region were collected during two series of sampling (cold and hot seasons) and analyzed by ELISA method. LCR, MoE, and HI indices were used to assess the possible risk of consuming milk containing AFM. In all taken samples AFM was found, the toxin concentration range in the first and second series of sampling was 57.5-270.6 ng/L and 57-185.9 ng/L, respectively. The level of toxin in pasteurized and sterilized milks in both sampling series was higher than raw milks. Based on the obtained data and in order to assess the risk of milk consumption in the target population, associated values with EDI, LCR, MoE, and HI were also calculated and obtained in the range of 0.145-0.3 ng/k.d b.w, 0.0008-0.0017 additional case per one million population, 1892.9-3921.6 and 0.72-1.5 ng/kg b.w, respectively.

"One fifth of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can increase the risk of cirrhosis, cancer, and death. To date, reported predictors of NASH progression have been heterogeneous.We identified determinants of fibrosis progression in patients with NASH in the United States using physician-reported data from the real-world Global Assessment of the Impact of NASH (GAIN) study, including demographics and clinical characteristics, NASH diagnostic information, fibrosis stage, comorbidities, and treatment. We developed a logistic regression model to assess the likelihood of fibrosis progression since diagnosis, controlling for sociodemographic and clinical variables. An iterative nested model selection approach using likelihood ratio test determined the final model.A total of 989 patients from the GAIN US cohort were included; 46% were women, 58% had biopsy-proven NAFLD, and 74% had fibrosis stage F0-F2 at diagnosis. The final multivariable model included age, years since diagnosis, sex, employment status, smoking status, obesity, fibrosis stage, diagnostic biopsy, Vitamin E, and liver transplant proposed at diagnosis. Odds of progression were 17% higher (odds ratio, 1.17 [95% CI: 1.11-1.23]; P < .001) with each year since NASH diagnosis, 41% lower (0.59 [0.38-0.90]; P = .016) for women than men, 131% higher (2.31 [1.30-4.03]; P = .004) for smokers versus non-smokers, and 89% higher (1.89 [1.26-2.86]; P = .002) with obesity. Odds of progression were also higher with part-time, retired, unemployed, and unable to work due to NASH status versus full-time employment, and when a liver transplant was proposed at diagnosis.Disease duration and severity, obesity, smoking, and lack of full-time employment were significant determinants of fibrosis progression.

"With prevalence high and rising given the close relationship with obesity and diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is progressively becoming the most common chronic liver condition worldwide. However, little is known about the health inequalities in NAFLD distribution and outcomes. This review aims to analyze health inequalities in NAFLD distribution globally and to assess the health disparities in NAFLD-related outcomes. We conducted a scoping review of global health inequalities in NAFLD distribution and outcomes according to gender/sex, ethnicity/race, and socioeconomic position from PubMed's inception to May 2021. Ultimately, 20 articles were included in the review, most (75%) of them carried out in the United States. Males were found to have a higher NAFLD prevalence (three articles), while available evidence suggests that women have an overall higher burden of advanced liver disease and complications (four articles), whereas they are less likely to be liver-transplanted once cirrhosis develops (one article). In the US, the Hispanic population had the highest NAFLD prevalence and poorer outcomes (seven articles), whereas Whites had fewer complications than other ethnicities (two articles). Patients with low socioeconomic status had higher NAFLD prevalence (four articles) and a higher likelihood of progression and complications (five articles). In conclusion, globally there is a lack of studies analyzing NAFLD prevalence and outcomes according to various axes of inequality through joint intersectional appraisals, and most studies included in our review were based on the US population. Available evidence suggests that NAFLD distribution and outcomes show large inequalities by social group. Further research on this issue is warranted.",prevalence high rising given close relationship obesity diabetes mellitus nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD progressively becoming common chronic liver condition worldwide However little known health inequalities NAFLD distribution outcomes review aims analyze health inequalities NAFLD distribution globally assess health disparities NAFLDrelated outcomes conducted scoping review global health inequalities NAFLD distribution outcomes according gendersex ethnicityrace socioeconomic position PubMeds inception May 2021 Ultimately 20 articles included review 75 carried United States Males found higher NAFLD prevalence three articles available evidence suggests women overall higher burden advanced liver disease complications four articles whereas less likely livertransplanted cirrhosis develops one article US Hispanic population highest NAFLD prevalence poorer outcomes seven articles whereas Whites fewer complications ethnicities two articles Patients low socioeconomic status higher NAFLD prevalence four articles higher likelihood progression complications five articles conclusion globally lack studies analyzing NAFLD prevalence outcomes according various axes inequality joint intersectional appraisals studies included review based US population Available evidence suggests NAFLD distribution outcomes show large inequalities social group research issue warranted

"Acid suppressants are widely-used classes of medications linked to increased risks of aerodigestive infections. Prior studies of these medications as potentially reversible risk factors for COVID-19 have been conflicting. We aimed to determine the impact of chronic acid suppression use on COVID-19 infection risk while simultaneously evaluating the influence of social determinants of health to validate known and discover novel risk factors. We assessed the association of chronic acid suppression with incident COVID-19 in a 1:1 case-control study of 900 patients tested across three academic medical centers in California, USA. Medical comorbidities and history of chronic acid suppression use were manually extracted from health records by physicians following a pre-specified protocol. Socio-behavioral factors by geomapping publicly-available data to patient zip codes were incorporated. We identified no evidence to support an association between chronic acid suppression and COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.92-1.17, P = 0.515). However, several medical and social features were positive (Latinx ethnicity, BMI ≥ 30, dementia, public transportation use, month of the pandemic) and negative (female sex, concurrent solid tumor, alcohol use disorder) predictors of new infection.

In order to see how the serologic responses change in relation to the clinical features, we selected a group of 472 adults with a positive IgM/IgG antibody test result from a baseline study of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, assessed their COVID-19 and past medical histories, and followed them up in about 3 months. Nearly one-fourth of the subjects were asymptomatic at the baseline; 12.8% subjects became symptomatic at the follow-up (FU) when 39.8% of the subjects had some persisting symptoms. At the baseline, 6.1% showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive, 59.3% only for IgG, and 34.5% for both.

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver and affects patients of all genders, races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic status. While the causes of HCC are numerous, the primary etiology is cirrhosis from alcohol and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the United States and from infectious agents such as Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C in the developing world. In patients at-risk for developing HCC, screening is recommended with ultrasound imaging and alpha fetoprotein laboratory tests. In socioeconomically vulnerable patients, however, individual-level barriers (eg, insurance status) and contextual-level disparities (eg, health facilities) may not be readily available, thus limiting screening. Additional challenges faced by racial/ethnic minorities can further challenge the spectrum of HCC care and lead to inadequate screening, delayed diagnosis, and unequal access to treatment. Efforts to improve these multilevel factors that lead to screening and treatment disparities are critical to overcoming challenges. Providing health insurance to those without access, improving societal challenges that confine patients to a lower socioeconomic status, and reducing challenges to seeking healthcare can decrease the morbidity and mortality of these patients. Additionally, engaging with communities and allowing them to collaborate in their own healthcare can also help to attenuate these inequities. Through collaborative multidisciplinary change, we can make progress in tackling disparities in vulnerable populations to achieve health equity.",Hepatocellular carcinoma HCC common primary malignancy liver affects patients genders races ethnicities socioeconomic status causes HCC numerous primary etiology cirrhosis alcohol nonalcoholic fatty liver disease United States infectious agents Hepatitis B Hepatitis C developing world patients atrisk developing HCC screening recommended ultrasound imaging alpha fetoprotein laboratory tests socioeconomically vulnerable patients however individuallevel barriers eg insurance status contextuallevel disparities eg health facilities may readily available thus limiting screening Additional challenges faced racialethnic minorities challenge spectrum HCC care lead inadequate screening delayed diagnosis unequal access treatment Efforts improve multilevel factors lead screening treatment disparities critical overcoming challenges Providing health insurance without access improving societal challenges confine patients lower socioeconomic status reducing challenges seeking healthcare decrease morbidity mortality patients Additionally engaging communities allowing collaborate healthcare also help attenuate inequities collaborative multidisciplinary change make progress tackling disparities vulnerable populations achieve health equity
"The Dehgolan Prospective Cohort Study (DehPCS) was conducted to examine and identify risk factors for the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In addition, in order to examine participants' health status, socioeconomic status, behavioral factors, nutritional status, and environmental exposures, the DehPCS collected, analyzed, and stored blood, urine, nail, and hair samples to conduct genetic studies and identify biomarkers and other biological determinants of NCDs. In total, 3,996 adults aged 35 to 70 from the general population participated in the study from February 2018 to March 2019. Of them, 43.7% were women. The first follow-up wave was conducted with 3,995 participants. Information on a wide range of variables was collected, including on socioeconomic status, lifestyle, nutritional status, habits, physical examination findings, medication use, and medical history. Proxy variables such as body mass index, metabolic equivalent task score, wealth index, and macronutrients and micronutrients were calculated. The most common self-reported diseases in descending order were kidney stones, hypertension, and fatty liver. The prevalence of diabetes and hypertension was 9.3% and 33.4%, respectively. All data, samples, and measurements will be collected again at 5-year intervals. Thus, it will be possible to examine time-dependent changes in the risk factors of NCDs. The DehPCS can be used to study the relationships among genetics, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and environmental risk factors and the most prevalent NCDs in case-cohort studies using a nested case-control design that will be applied to the cohort infrastructure.

"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a crisis that disproportionately affected populations already disadvantaged with respect to access to health care systems and adequate medical care and treatments. Understanding how and where health care disparities are most widespread is an important starting point for exploring opportunities to mitigate such disparities, especially within our patient population with liver disease. In a webinar in LiverLearning, we discussed the impact of the pandemic on the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, highlighting the disproportionate effects on infection rates and death for certain ethnic minorities, those socioeconomically disadvantaged and living in higher density areas, and those working in health care and other essential jobs. We set forth a ""call to action"" for members of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the larger community of providers of liver disease care to generate viable solutions to improve access to care and vaccination rates of our patients against COVID-19, and in general help reduce health care disparities and improve the health of disadvantaged populations within their communities.

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease globally and is estimated to affect approximately 25% of the world's population. Data about the prevalence and incidence of NAFLD in Africa are scarce, but the prevalence is estimated to be 13·5% for the general population. This is likely to be an underestimate considering the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases, particularly the rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, driven by the overlapping challenges of food insecurity, nutritional transition, and associated increased consumption of calorie-dense foods.

"There is limited information regarding the protective factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This research is focused on analyzing the role of vitamin D and albumin in the severity, progression, or possible prevention of COVID-19 infection. In this case-control study, 191 patients and 203 healthy individuals were enrolled. Blood samples were taken to test the albumin and vitamin D levels of both groups. Our results show a direct association of vitamin D deficiency with the infection of COVID-19 and severity. According to our findings, 84.4% of patients with COVID-19 in this study had vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, the average level of albumin was significantly decreased in those infected patients who had respiratory symptoms. In the present study, a considerable negative correlation was established between the levels of vitamin D and the severity of COVID-19 infection. This reflects on the immunomodulatory and inhibitory nature of vitamin D to the viral replication.",limited information regarding protective factors SARSCoV2 infection research focused analyzing role vitamin albumin severity progression possible prevention COVID19 infection casecontrol study 191 patients 203 healthy individuals enrolled Blood samples taken test albumin vitamin levels groups results show direct association vitamin deficiency infection COVID19 severity According findings 844 patients COVID19 study vitamin deficiency Moreover average level albumin significantly decreased infected patients respiratory symptoms present study considerable negative correlation established levels vitamin severity COVID19 infection reflects immunomodulatory inhibitory nature vitamin viral replication
"The social determinants of health, defined as the conditions in which we live, learn, work, and play, undoubtedly impact health outcomes. Social adversity in childhood perpetuates over the life course and has consequences extending into adulthood. This link between social adversity and adverse outcomes extends to children undergoing liver transplant, with children from socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods experiencing a greater burden of morbidity and mortality after transplant. Yet, we lack an in-depth understanding of how to address social adversity for these children. Herein, we lay out a strategy to develop and test interventions to address social adversity for children undergoing liver transplant. To do so, we believe that more granular data on how specific social risk factors (e.g., food insecurity) impact outcomes for children after liver transplant are needed. This will provide the liver transplant community with knowledge on the most pressing problems. Then, using the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's framework for integrating social needs into medical care, the health system can start to develop and test health system interventions. We believe that attending to our patients' social adversity will realize improved outcomes for children undergoing liver transplant.",social determinants health defined conditions live learn work play undoubtedly impact health outcomes Social adversity childhood perpetuates life course consequences extending adulthood link social adversity adverse outcomes extends children undergoing liver transplant children socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods experiencing greater burden morbidity mortality transplant Yet lack indepth understanding address social adversity children Herein lay strategy develop test interventions address social adversity children undergoing liver transplant believe granular data specific social risk factors eg food insecurity impact outcomes children liver transplant needed provide liver transplant community knowledge pressing problems using National Academies Sciences Engineering Medicines framework integrating social needs medical care health system start develop test health system interventions believe attending patients social adversity realize improved outcomes children undergoing liver transplant
"Recent evidence suggests that, in some foci, elimination of onchocerciasis from Africa may be feasible with mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin. To achieve continental elimination of transmission, mapping surveys will need to be conducted across all implementation units (IUs) for which endemicity status is currently unknown. Using boosted regression tree models with optimised hyperparameter selection, we estimated environmental suitability for onchocerciasis at the 5 × 5-km resolution across Africa. In order to classify IUs that include locations that are environmentally suitable, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify an optimal threshold for suitability concordant with locations where onchocerciasis has been previously detected. This threshold value was then used to classify IUs (more suitable or less suitable) based on the location within the IU with the largest mean prediction. Mean estimates of environmental suitability suggest large areas across West and Central Africa, as well as focal areas of East Africa, are suitable for onchocerciasis transmission, consistent with the presence of current control and elimination of transmission efforts. The ROC analysis identified a mean environmental suitability index of 0·71 as a threshold to classify based on the location with the largest mean prediction within the IU. Of the IUs considered for mapping surveys, 50·2% exceed this threshold for suitability in at least one 5 × 5-km location. The formidable scale of data collection required to map onchocerciasis endemicity across the African continent presents an opportunity to use spatial data to identify areas likely to be suitable for onchocerciasis transmission. National onchocerciasis elimination programmes may wish to consider prioritising these IUs for mapping surveys as human resources, laboratory capacity, and programmatic schedules may constrain survey implementation, and possibly delaying MDA initiation in areas that would ultimately qualify.",Recent evidence suggests foci elimination onchocerciasis Africa may feasible mass drug administration MDA ivermectin achieve continental elimination transmission mapping surveys need conducted across implementation units IUs endemicity status currently unknown Using boosted regression tree models optimised hyperparameter selection estimated environmental suitability onchocerciasis 5 5km resolution across Africa order classify IUs include locations environmentally suitable used receiver operating characteristic ROC analysis identify optimal threshold suitability concordant locations onchocerciasis previously detected threshold value used classify IUs suitable less suitable based location within IU largest mean prediction Mean estimates environmental suitability suggest large areas across West Central Africa well focal areas East Africa suitable onchocerciasis transmission consistent presence current control elimination transmission efforts ROC analysis identified mean environmental suitability index 071 threshold classify based location largest mean prediction within IU IUs considered mapping surveys 502 exceed threshold suitability least one 5 5km location formidable scale data collection required map onchocerciasis endemicity across African continent presents opportunity use spatial data identify areas likely suitable onchocerciasis transmission National onchocerciasis elimination programmes may wish consider prioritising IUs mapping surveys human resources laboratory capacity programmatic schedules may constrain survey implementation possibly delaying MDA initiation areas would ultimately qualify
"Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to prevent vitamin D deficiency, but various factors can affect the response to supplementation. Data mining is a statistical method for pulling out information from large databases. We aimed to evaluate the factors influencing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in response to supplementation of vitamin D using a random forest (RF) model. Data were extracted from the survey of ultraviolet intake by nutritional approach study. Vitamin D levels were measured at baseline and at the end of study to evaluate the responsiveness. We examined the relationship between 76 potential influencing factors on vitamin D response using RF. We found several features that were highly correlated to the serum vitamin D response to supplementation by RF including anthropometric factors (body mass index [BMI], free fat mass [FFM], fat percentage, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]), liver function tests (serum gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], total bilirubin, total protein), hematological parameters (mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC], hematocrit), and measurement of insulin sensitivity (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance). BMI, total bilirubin, FFM, and GGT were found to have a positive relationship and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance, MCV, MCHC, fat percentage, total protein, and WHR were found to have a negative correlation to vitamin D concentration in response to supplementation. The accuracy of RF in predicting the response was 93% compared to logistic regression, for which the accuracy was 40%, in the evaluation of the correlation of the components of the data set to serum vitamin D.",Vitamin supplementation shown prevent vitamin deficiency various factors affect response supplementation Data mining statistical method pulling information large databases aimed evaluate factors influencing serum 25hydroxyvitamin levels response supplementation vitamin using random forest RF model Data extracted survey ultraviolet intake nutritional approach study Vitamin levels measured baseline end study evaluate responsiveness examined relationship 76 potential influencing factors vitamin response using RF found several features highly correlated serum vitamin response supplementation RF including anthropometric factors body mass index BMI free fat mass FFM fat percentage waisttohip ratio WHR liver function tests serum gammaglutamyl transferase GGT total bilirubin total protein hematological parameters mean corpuscular volume MCV mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration MCHC hematocrit measurement insulin sensitivity homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance BMI total bilirubin FFM GGT found positive relationship homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance MCV MCHC fat percentage total protein WHR found negative correlation vitamin concentration response supplementation accuracy RF predicting response 93 compared logistic regression accuracy 40 evaluation correlation components data set serum vitamin

"Organ allocation in liver transplantation (LT) remains imperfect. Periodic center reviews ensure programs transparently evaluate the impact of practice on access to transplantation, reflecting, in particular, patient (primary disease, social determinants) and program (deceased versus live donation) factors. Adult Ontario residents waitlisted for first LT at Toronto General Hospital from November 2012 to May 2019 were reviewed. Analyses were performed between distance to transplant center, income, education level, population density and primary liver disease, with LT, deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT), living donor liver transplant (LDLT), and delisting. Of 1735 listed patients, 549 were delisted (32%), while 1071 were transplanted (62%), with 819 DDLT recipients (76%) and 252 LDLT recipients (24%), while 115 (7%) remained actively listed at data census. On univariate analysis, DDLT recipients lived 30% closer (median 39.7 versus 60.6 km; P < 0.001), lived in more populous areas (median 8501.0 versus 6868.5 people in a 1-km radius; P < 0.001), and resided in households that annually earned 10% less (median $92,643.17 versus $102,820.89 Canadian dollars; P < 0.001) compared with LDLT recipients. These findings with population density and income differences between DDLT versus LDLT receival remained significant on multivariate modeling even when accounting for primary liver disease. Primary liver disease was a statistically significant factor on multivariate analyses in LT receival (P = 0.001) as well as DDLT versus LDLT receival (P < 0.001). Of patients listed for end-stage liver disease, more patients with autoimmune cholestatic liver diseases received LDLT (34%-41%) than DDLT (27%-30%); this contrasted with patients with noncholestatic diseases LDLT (8%-19%) versus DDLT (37%-59%) receival (P < 0.001).

"Melatonin has shown promising effects in controlling the progress of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), introducing it as a possible candidate for NAFLD treatment. In this context, the current study is aimed to evaluate melatonin's effect on the plasma levels of Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, cholesterol, triglyceride, and liver aminotransferases in NAFLD patients. NAFLD and melatonin, as well as their related terms, were searched in electronic databases, until May 1st, 2020. The initial search identified 1152 studies. Considering inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final seven articles were included in the study. The methodology of the articles was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Alanine transaminase levels were significantly lowered with melatonin treatment but not earlier than the 4th week (P = 0.010 and 0.519, respectively). Aspartate aminotransferase levels didn't show significant alteration before 4 weeks, although exhibiting substantial decline in total (P = 0.697 and 0.008, respectively). Alkaline phosphatase changes under 4 weeks of follow-up were not significant (P = 0.3), however, it decreased significantly in total (P = 0.006). A significant decline was detected in triglyceride levels after melatonin treatment (P = 0.015). There was a significant reduction in cholesterol levels (P = 0.005). Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels were also significantly different after the administration of melatonin (P < 0.001). Melatonin could reduce the progress of NAFLD. It might also decrement hepatic function parameters. Thus, it could be used for managing NAFLD and possibly as part of the treatment plan for patients with NAFLD.",Melatonin shown promising effects controlling progress nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD introducing possible candidate NAFLD treatment context current study aimed evaluate melatonins effect plasma levels Gammaglutamyl transpeptidase cholesterol triglyceride liver aminotransferases NAFLD patients NAFLD melatonin well related terms searched electronic databases May 1st 2020 initial search identified 1152 studies Considering inclusion exclusion criteria final seven articles included study methodology articles assessed NewcastleOttawa Scale Alanine transaminase levels significantly lowered melatonin treatment earlier 4th week P 0010 0519 respectively Aspartate aminotransferase levels didnt show significant alteration 4 weeks although exhibiting substantial decline total P 0697 0008 respectively Alkaline phosphatase changes 4 weeks followup significant P 03 however decreased significantly total P 0006 significant decline detected triglyceride levels melatonin treatment P 0015 significant reduction cholesterol levels P 0005 Gammaglutamyl transpeptidase levels also significantly different administration melatonin P 0001 Melatonin could reduce progress NAFLD might also decrement hepatic function parameters Thus could used managing NAFLD possibly part treatment plan patients NAFLD
"Autoimmune liver diseases are attributed to a complex interplay of biologic, acquired, and environmental factors. Increased prevalence, later stage at presentation, worse response to standard therapy, and transplant-related disparities have all been reported in racial and ethnic minorities such as Black and Latinx patients with autoimmune liver diseases. While biology and inherited genetic predispositions may partly explain these disparities, definitive and universal genetic variations underlying these differences in outcomes have not been defined. Nonetheless, socioeconomic status, access to health care, environmental and societal factors, and implicit provider bias can all contribute to poor patient outcomes. There remains an unmet need to understand and mitigate the factors contributing to health inequity in autoimmune liver diseases. In this review, we summarize the data on racial and ethnic disparities in presentation, treatment response, and outcomes pertaining to autoimmune liver diseases in minority populations, on the premise that understanding disparities is the first step toward reaching health equity.",Autoimmune liver diseases attributed complex interplay biologic acquired environmental factors Increased prevalence later stage presentation worse response standard therapy transplantrelated disparities reported racial ethnic minorities Black Latinx patients autoimmune liver diseases biology inherited genetic predispositions may partly explain disparities definitive universal genetic variations underlying differences outcomes defined Nonetheless socioeconomic status access health care environmental societal factors implicit provider bias contribute poor patient outcomes remains unmet need understand mitigate factors contributing health inequity autoimmune liver diseases review summarize data racial ethnic disparities presentation treatment response outcomes pertaining autoimmune liver diseases minority populations premise understanding disparities first step toward reaching health equity
"Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhoea. This bacterium infects the epithelial cells of the cervix of women and the urethra of men. However, its disease symptoms in the lower genitalia are found only in a small percentage of people. This study aimed to compare the frequency of N. gonorrhoeae genital infection among two groups of pregnant women, those with spontaneous abortions and those with normal pregnancies. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Western Iran. It included 417 women: 109 of whom had spontaneous abortions, 109 had normal deliveries, 100 were fertile, and 99 were infertile. Specific primers were used and DNA was extracted by endocervical swabs. A polymerase chain reaction test was then performed to detect N. gonorrhoeae. Data analysis was performed using the chi-squared test and t-tests. In all the above steps, a level of 5% was considered statistically significant, and the average ages in women with normal delivery, women with spontaneous abortion, fertile women, and infertile women were 27.8 ± 4.87, 29.6 ± 5.9, 32.1 ± 5.1, and 29.1 ± 6.3 years, respectively.

"The novel coronavirus outbreak began in late December 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide, critically impacting public health systems. A number of already approved and marketed drugs are being tested for repurposing, including Favipiravir. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of Favipiravir in treatment of COVID-19 patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We registered the protocol in the PROSPERO (CRD42020180032). All clinical trials which addressed the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in comparison to other control groups for treatment of patients with confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 were included. We searched electronic databases including LitCovid/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane, and Scientific Information Database up to 31 December 2020. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies using Cochrane Collaboration criteria. All analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2, and the risk ratio index was calculated. Egger and Begg test was used for assessing publication bias. Nine studies were included in our meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis revealed a significant clinical improvement in the Favipiravir group versus the control group during seven days after hospitalization (RR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41; P = 0.001). Viral clearance was more in 14 days after hospitalization in Favipiravir group than control group, but this finding marginally not significant (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.98-1.25; P = 0.094). Requiring supplemental oxygen therapy in the Favipiravir group was 7% less than the control group, (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.67-1.28; P = 0.664). Transferred to ICU and adverse events were not statistically different between two groups. The mortality rate in the Favipiravir group was approximately 30% less than the control group, but this finding not statistically significant. Favipiravir possibly exerted no significant beneficial effect in the term of mortality in the general group of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

"The present study aimed to determine the average concentration of some metals, including cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and lead (Pb) in the chicken, hen's liver, and gizzard in the east of Iran. Estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risk (CR) were calculated. In this cross-sectional study, fifty one samples including chicken, hen's liver and gizzard were obtained from Birjand, Iran. Measurement of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb was carried out by using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). All of the measured metals were detected in 100 % of the samples. The metals had a different distribution pattern. The highest concentration of Cd and Cu was in the liver samples while the Cr and Ni had the highest levels in the chicken.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed healthcare inequities in the USA and highlighted the importance of social conditions in shaping the health of persons. In the field of hepatology, social determinants of health (SDOH) are closely linked to disparities in liver disease prevalence, outcomes, and access to treatment. The economic disruption and physical distancing policies brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic have further exacerbated these disparities, and may have long-lasting health consequences for marginalized patients with chronic liver disease. There are several ways that hepatology providers can bridge the gap in health equity through addressing SDOH, extending from the individual to the community and societal levels. Interventions at the individual level include implementation of systematic screening for social barriers in our hepatology practices to identify gaps in the care cascade. At the community and societal levels, interventions include creating collaborative partnerships with public health workers to expand healthcare access to the community, increasing funding for research investigating the association of SDOH, health disparities, and liver disease, engaging in advocacy to support policy reform that tackles the upstream social determinants, and addressing racism and implicit bias. As hepatology practices adapt to the ""new normal,"" now is the time for us to address our patients' social needs within the context of healthcare delivery and reimagine ways in which to provide care to best serve our most vulnerable patients with liver disease in the COVID-19 era and beyond.",COVID19 pandemic exposed healthcare inequities USA highlighted importance social conditions shaping health persons field hepatology social determinants health SDOH closely linked disparities liver disease prevalence outcomes access treatment economic disruption physical distancing policies brought COVID19 pandemic exacerbated disparities may longlasting health consequences marginalized patients chronic liver disease several ways hepatology providers bridge gap health equity addressing SDOH extending individual community societal levels Interventions individual level include implementation systematic screening social barriers hepatology practices identify gaps care cascade community societal levels interventions include creating collaborative partnerships public health workers expand healthcare access community increasing funding research investigating association SDOH health disparities liver disease engaging advocacy support policy reform tackles upstream social determinants addressing racism implicit bias hepatology practices adapt new normal time us address patients social needs within context healthcare delivery reimagine ways provide care best serve vulnerable patients liver disease COVID19 era beyond

"The present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of the signaling pathways mutation rate in the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers in a systematic review and meta-analysis study. The study was performed based on the PRISMA criteria. Random models by confidence interval (CI: 95%) were used to calculate the pooled estimate of prevalence via Metaprop command. The pooled prevalence indices of signal transduction pathway mutations in gastric cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer were 5% (95% CI: 3-8%), 12% (95% CI: 8-18%), 17% (95% CI: 14-20%), and 20% (95% CI: 5-41%), respectively. Also, the mutation rates for Wnt pathway and MAPK pathway were calculated to be 23% (95% CI, 14-33%) and 20% (95% CI, 17-24%), respectively. Moreover, the most popular genes were APC (in Wnt pathway), KRAS (in MAPK pathway) and PIK3CA (in PI3K pathway) in the colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer while they were beta-catenin and CTNNB1 in liver cancer. The most altered pathway was Wnt pathway followed by the MAPK pathway.

"Zinc phosphide is a gray to black powder mainly used as a rodenticide. In contact with gastric fluid, it releases phosphine which is the main toxic material of this compound. Phosphine interferes with oxidative respiratory cycle of the cells, but is generally expected to manifest its toxicity with prodromal signs and symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, metabolic acidosis, and increased liver function tests. A 64-year-old man was referred to our center with the history of ingestion of three full table spoons of zinc phosphide powder with only a mild GI discomfort. Abdominal X-ray revealed radiopaque material in epigastric and abdominal right upper quadrant. Despite treatment with polyethylene glycol and completely normal vital signs and lab tests, he experienced sudden cardiac arrest 19 h after admission. Autopsy showed clues of focal myopathy and fibrosis with evidences of ischemia and congestion in cardiac tissue, pulmonary edema, shrunken bilateral kidneys, and nutmeg yellow liver. Toxicology panel confirmed the presence of phosphine and zinc phosphide in the gastric fluid.

"Since 2000, many countries have achieved considerable success in improving child survival, but localized progress remains unclear. To inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.2-to end preventable child deaths by 2030-we need consistently estimated data at the subnational level regarding child mortality rates and trends. Here we quantified, for the period 2000-2017, the subnational variation in mortality rates and number of deaths of neonates, infants and children under 5 years of age within 99 low- and middle-income countries using a geostatistical survival model. We estimated that 32% of children under 5 in these countries lived in districts that had attained rates of 25 or fewer child deaths per 1,000 live births by 2017, and that 58% of child deaths between 2000 and 2017 in these countries could have been averted in the absence of geographical inequality. This study enables the identification of high-mortality clusters, patterns of progress and geographical inequalities to inform appropriate investments and implementations that will help to improve the health of all populations.",Since 2000 many countries achieved considerable success improving child survival localized progress remains unclear inform efforts towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 32to end preventable child deaths 2030we need consistently estimated data subnational level regarding child mortality rates trends quantified period 20002017 subnational variation mortality rates number deaths neonates infants children 5 years age within 99 low middleincome countries using geostatistical survival model estimated 32 children 5 countries lived districts attained rates 25 fewer child deaths per 1000 live births 2017 58 child deaths 2000 2017 countries could averted absence geographical inequality study enables identification highmortality clusters patterns progress geographical inequalities inform appropriate investments implementations help improve health populations

"Background The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of D-penicillamine in the treatment of lead poisoning mainly in the outpatient setting. Methods In a case series study performed during the recent epidemic of lead poisoning in Iran, lead-poisoned patients referring to our outpatient clinic were treated with 250-mg D-penicillamine capsules administered every 6 h for 5 or 10 days based on availability of the medication. They were recommended to re-check blood lead level (BLL) 4 weeks after cessation of the treatment and refer to our clinic again. Results In 63 patients with lead poisoning but without signs and symptoms of lead encephalopathy, median BLL was 106 [84, 131] μg/dL on presentation, which declined to a mean of 52.6 ± 28.8 μg/dL after a median treatment period of 7 [5, 10] days (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the 5- and 10-day treatment protocols regarding complications and recovery. Treatment had resulted in a median decrease of 54 μg/dL [33, 90] (range: -20 to 231 μg/dL) in the patients' BLLs (33.9% declined in BLL measurements; range: -29.69% to 99.06%). Conclusions D-penicillamine may be an acceptable substitute treatment in adult lead poisoning. Although our sample size was limited, we could not detect any serious adverse effects in our cases showing that D-penicillamine resulted in acceptable recovery rates.

"Preterm birth and small for gestational age (SGA) are major contributors to neonatal mortality in India. However, social determinates of preterm births and SGA are poorly characterized. We use population-based data from a health and demographic surveillance system (HDSS) in rural West Bengal, India, to examine risk factors for preterm birth and SGA. HDSS pregnancy cohort data for 2430 pregnant women were used in this analysis. Of 2430 pregnancies, 16% were preterm births and 38.2% were SGA. Results from logistic regression reveal that higher maternal education (≥11 years) was associated with reduced risk of preterm births and SGA. Greater wealth quintile was also associated with decreased risk of preterm births and SGA (p-value for trend: <0.05). In light of the findings, ensuring effective coverage of preterm and SGA interventions among women of low socioeconomic status will be essential to mitigate the large burden of preterm births and SGA.",Preterm birth small gestational age SGA major contributors neonatal mortality India However social determinates preterm births SGA poorly characterized use populationbased data health demographic surveillance system HDSS rural West Bengal India examine risk factors preterm birth SGA HDSS pregnancy cohort data 2430 pregnant women used analysis 2430 pregnancies 16 preterm births 382 SGA Results logistic regression reveal higher maternal education 11 years associated reduced risk preterm births SGA Greater wealth quintile also associated decreased risk preterm births SGA pvalue trend 005 light findings ensuring effective coverage preterm SGA interventions among women low socioeconomic status essential mitigate large burden preterm births SGA
"This study aimed to evaluate the mean concentration of cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) in the meat and offal of cow and sheep. Also, the estimated daily intake (EDI) and health risk of these metals were calculated. Analysis of metals was undertaken by the use of an inductively coupled plasma-optic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). All samples were contaminated with all metals. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear differentiation of cow and sheep in both the kidney and liver samples. In the liver and kidney, level of Cd, Cu, and Pb were positively correlated.

"Today, one of the most important global public health challenges is represented by hepatitis C virus (HCV), which imposes relevant costs. Globally speaking, the median cost of HCV-related complications ranges from $280 for an uncomplicated hepatitis to $139,070 for a liver transplantation. There are effective therapies for HCV patients worldwide, which has increased the hope of improving the process of managing and curing these patients. The adherence of patients to the pharmacological treatment and the use of effective drugs in the management of HCV disease are of crucial importance for health policy- and decision-makers. Studies show that, globally, insurance coverage for patients with HCV is not adequate in that still many patients are not covered by insurance programs. This issue as well as the economic conditions of countries are very serious challenges for ensuring an effective treatment. The most important and greatest help currently available to ensure HCV treatment is to implement plans to reduce costs and support patients. Some studies have shown that the expansion of coverage by private payers seems able to generate positive spillover benefits to public insures. Insurers, in addition to maintaining and increasing their own interests, are trying to increase their social status as a sponsor of patients. In conclusion, HCV disease requires serious policies and affordable insurance coverage.",Today one important global public health challenges represented hepatitis C virus HCV imposes relevant costs Globally speaking median cost HCVrelated complications ranges 280 uncomplicated hepatitis 139070 liver transplantation effective therapies HCV patients worldwide increased hope improving process managing curing patients adherence patients pharmacological treatment use effective drugs management HCV disease crucial importance health policy decisionmakers Studies show globally insurance coverage patients HCV adequate still many patients covered insurance programs issue well economic conditions countries serious challenges ensuring effective treatment important greatest help currently available ensure HCV treatment implement plans reduce costs support patients studies shown expansion coverage private payers seems able generate positive spillover benefits public insures Insurers addition maintaining increasing interests trying increase social status sponsor patients conclusion HCV disease requires serious policies affordable insurance coverage

"Deaths of despair (DOD) is a new term appearing in public health literature to describe deaths attributable to suicide, liver disease, and drug overdose. In Florida, suicide and liver disease are the 8th and 10th leading causes of death, respectively. Additional mortality data show that the rate of drug overdose deaths in Florida is 12.5% higher than the suicide death rate. Some have hypothesized that economic social determinants of health (SDH) may be responsible for the recent increase in DOD. The current study, using secondary data, sought to identify what county-level SDH were significantly associated with county-level DOD. Using backward regression methodology, the results of the analysis indicate that 44% of the variance in county-level DOD is significantly associated with six county-level SDH: (a) Recent Medical Checkup, (b) Income, (c) Education Level, (d) Age, (e) Mental Health Professionals, and (f) the Income × Age interaction term. Higher than average income, age, and mental health professionals in a Florida county was associated with significantly higher rates of DOD.

"Most chronic diseases follow a socioeconomic gradient with higher rates in lower socioeconomic groups. A growing body of research, however, reveals cancer to be a disease group with very diverse socioeconomic patterning, even demonstrating reverse socioeconomic gradients for certain cancers. To investigate this matter at the German national level for the first time, this study examined socioeconomic inequalities in cancer incidence in Germany, both for all cancers combined as well as for common site-specific cancers. Population-based data on primary cancers newly diagnosed in 2010-2013 was obtained from the German Centre for Cancer Registry Data. Socioeconomic position was assessed at the district level using the German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation, which is a composite index of area-based socioeconomic indicators. Absolute and relative socioeconomic inequalities in total and site-specific cancer incidence were analyzed using multilevel Poisson regression models with the logarithm of the number of residents as an offset. Among men, socioeconomic inequalities in cancer incidence with higher rates in more deprived districts were found for all cancers combined and various site-specific cancers, most pronounced for cancers of the lung, oral and upper respiratory tract, stomach, kidney, and bladder. Among women, higher rates in more deprived districts were evident for kidney, bladder, stomach, cervical, and liver cancer as well as for lymphoid/hematopoietic neoplasms, but no inequalities were evident for all cancers combined. Reverse gradients with higher rates in less deprived districts were found for malignant melanoma and thyroid cancer in both sexes, and in women additionally for female breast and ovarian cancer. Whereas in men the vast majority of all incident cancers occurred at cancer sites showing higher incidence rates in more deprived districts and cancers with a reverse socioeconomic gradient were in a clear minority, the situation was more balanced for women. This is the first national study from Germany examining socioeconomic inequalities in total and site-specific cancer incidence. The findings demonstrate that the socioeconomic patterning of cancer is diverse and follows different directions depending on the cancer site. The area-based cancer inequalities found suggest potentials for population-based cancer prevention and can help develop local strategies for cancer prevention and control.",chronic diseases follow socioeconomic gradient higher rates lower socioeconomic groups growing body research however reveals cancer disease group diverse socioeconomic patterning even demonstrating reverse socioeconomic gradients certain cancers investigate matter German national level first time study examined socioeconomic inequalities cancer incidence Germany cancers combined well common sitespecific cancers Populationbased data primary cancers newly diagnosed 20102013 obtained German Centre Cancer Registry Data Socioeconomic position assessed district level using German Index Socioeconomic Deprivation composite index areabased socioeconomic indicators Absolute relative socioeconomic inequalities total sitespecific cancer incidence analyzed using multilevel Poisson regression models logarithm number residents offset Among men socioeconomic inequalities cancer incidence higher rates deprived districts found cancers combined various sitespecific cancers pronounced cancers lung oral upper respiratory tract stomach kidney bladder Among women higher rates deprived districts evident kidney bladder stomach cervical liver cancer well lymphoidhematopoietic neoplasms inequalities evident cancers combined Reverse gradients higher rates less deprived districts found malignant melanoma thyroid cancer sexes women additionally female breast ovarian cancer Whereas men vast majority incident cancers occurred cancer sites showing higher incidence rates deprived districts cancers reverse socioeconomic gradient clear minority situation balanced women first national study Germany examining socioeconomic inequalities total sitespecific cancer incidence findings demonstrate socioeconomic patterning cancer diverse follows different directions depending cancer site areabased cancer inequalities found suggest potentials populationbased cancer prevention help develop local strategies cancer prevention control

"In the past, communicable diseases caused the highest mortality in Iran. Improvements in socioeconomic status and living standards including access to safe drinking water, along with the inception of Health Houses in the 1980s, have changed disease patterns, decreasing the spread of and deaths from infectious and communicable diseases. The incidence and prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCD), however, have now increased in Iran, accounting for nearly 80% of deaths and disabilities. Without interventions, NCD are predicted to impose a substantial human and economic burden in the next 2 decades. However, Iran's health system is not equipped with the necessary policies to combat this growth and must refocus and reform. Therefore, in the year 2013, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education funded a well-designed nationwide cohort study-Prospective Epidemiological Research Studies in IrAN (PERSIAN)-in order to assess the burden of NCD and investigate the risk factors associated with them in the different ethnicities and geographical areas of Iran. The PERSIAN Cohort, which aims to include 200000 participants, has 4 components: Adult (main), Birth, Youth and Elderly, which are being carried out in 22 different regions of Iran. Having an enormous dataset along with a biobank of blood, urine, hair and nail samples, the PERSIAN Cohort will serve as an important infrastructure for future implementation research and will provide the evidence needed for new healthcare policies in order to better control, manage and prevent NCD.",past communicable diseases caused highest mortality Iran Improvements socioeconomic status living standards including access safe drinking water along inception Health Houses 1980s changed disease patterns decreasing spread deaths infectious communicable diseases incidence prevalence noncommunicable diseases NCD however increased Iran accounting nearly 80 deaths disabilities Without interventions NCD predicted impose substantial human economic burden next 2 decades However Irans health system equipped necessary policies combat growth must refocus reform Therefore year 2013 Ministry Health Medical Education funded welldesigned nationwide cohort studyProspective Epidemiological Research Studies IrAN PERSIANin order assess burden NCD investigate risk factors associated different ethnicities geographical areas Iran PERSIAN Cohort aims include 200000 participants 4 components Adult main Birth Youth Elderly carried 22 different regions Iran enormous dataset along biobank blood urine hair nail samples PERSIAN Cohort serve important infrastructure future implementation research provide evidence needed new healthcare policies order better control manage prevent NCD

"The Great East Japan Earthquake occurred on March 11, 2011, and was followed by a nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. The government ordered a mandatory evacuation from the high radioactive concentration area in Fukushima. This evacuation may have forced many evacuees to change specific aspects of their lifestyles such as diet and physical activity, which in turn may lead to future incidence of lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). To address this concern, the association between the evacuation and changes in CVD risk factors before and after the disaster was examined in the Fukushima Health Management Survey. In the present study, we reviewed the results of longitudinal studies in the Fukushima Health Management Survey. The proportion of overweight/obese people and those with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, liver dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and polycythemia increased after the disaster. Furthermore, the evacuation was associated with an increase of these cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, evacuees may be more disposed to CVDs such as myocardial infarction and stroke after the disaster. The prevention of future CVDs among evacuees from Fukushima requires ongoing preventive programs for obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, in collaboration with local governments and communities.",Great East Japan Earthquake occurred March 11 2011 followed nuclear accident Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant government ordered mandatory evacuation high radioactive concentration area Fukushima evacuation may forced many evacuees change specific aspects lifestyles diet physical activity turn may lead future incidence lifestyle diseases cardiovascular diseases CVDs address concern association evacuation changes CVD risk factors disaster examined Fukushima Health Management Survey present study reviewed results longitudinal studies Fukushima Health Management Survey proportion overweightobese people hypertension diabetes mellitus dyslipidemia liver dysfunction atrial fibrillation polycythemia increased disaster Furthermore evacuation associated increase cardiovascular risk factors Therefore evacuees may disposed CVDs myocardial infarction stroke disaster prevention future CVDs among evacuees Fukushima requires ongoing preventive programs obesity hypertension diabetes mellitus dyslipidemia collaboration local governments communities

A striking electrophysiological change of hippocampal neurons in experimental model of BDL was observed in the present study. Spontaneous firing frequency and rate of action potential (AP) rebound was decreased and afterhyperpolarization amplitude (AHP) was increased significantly in hippocampal cells of BDL animals compared to sham group. Together, the results suggest that altered intrinsic properties of the hippocampal neurons may contribute to the cognitive abnormalities during hepatic encephalopathy (HE), highlighting the electrophysiological mechanisms for providing new treatments against HE.",Although key contributors altering neurological function hepatic encephalopathy relatively well known electrophysiological mechanism CA1 damage key vulnerable area hyperammonemia yet defined Therefore focus electrophysiological mechanisms cognitive impairments following bile duct ligation BDL performed patchclamp recordings CA1 pyramidal neurons hippocampus male Wistar rats underwent sham BDL surgery striking electrophysiological change hippocampal neurons experimental model BDL observed present study Spontaneous firing frequency rate action potential AP rebound decreased afterhyperpolarization amplitude AHP increased significantly hippocampal cells BDL animals compared sham group Together results suggest altered intrinsic properties hippocampal neurons may contribute cognitive abnormalities hepatic encephalopathy highlighting electrophysiological mechanisms providing new treatments
"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are considered as major public health problems. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of MSDs in Azar cohort population in northwest of Iran. Azar cohort study is a state level of a national cohort project (PERSIAN) which began in 2014. All adults over 35 years old in Khamene city in East Azarbaijan province were recruited for the pilot phase of the Azar cohort. For the purpose of the current study, a total of 952 subjects age range of 35-70 who completed the Community Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic Disease (COPCORD) questionnaire as supplementary were included. 299 subjects had MSDs and were introduced to the rheumatologist, only 237 of them referred for further assessment. 33.4% of subjects had MSDs within the past 7 days. The most frequent complaint was pain and the most common sites of complaints were knee, lumbar spine, and shoulder, respectively. Osteoarthritis was the most common rheumatic disease (53.2%) and the knee was the most common region affected (47.7%) followed by low back pain (28.2%). Osteoarthritis and knee osteoarthritis were present in 56.1 and 51.8% of females and 46.6 and 38.4% of males, respectively. Furthermore, low back pain was present in 32.9% of males and 26.2% of females. Peri-arthritis was more prevalent in males (12.3%), whilst fibromyalgia, psychologic pain, and heel spur were prevalent among females (9.1, 5.1, and 1.2%, respectively). Rheumatoid arthritis was observed in 1.4% of males and 1.8% of females, respectively. Prevalence of MSDs is very high in this area. Therefore, it calls for action by heath officials and professionals to plan for appropriate programs of prevention and management of MSDs in society.",Musculoskeletal disorders MSDs considered major public health problems purpose study determine prevalence MSDs Azar cohort population northwest Iran Azar cohort study state level national cohort project PERSIAN began 2014 adults 35 years old Khamene city East Azarbaijan province recruited pilot phase Azar cohort purpose current study total 952 subjects age range 3570 completed Community Oriented Program Control Rheumatic Disease COPCORD questionnaire supplementary included 299 subjects MSDs introduced rheumatologist 237 referred assessment 334 subjects MSDs within past 7 days frequent complaint pain common sites complaints knee lumbar spine shoulder respectively Osteoarthritis common rheumatic disease 532 knee common region affected 477 followed low back pain 282 Osteoarthritis knee osteoarthritis present 561 518 females 466 384 males respectively Furthermore low back pain present 329 males 262 females Periarthritis prevalent males 123 whilst fibromyalgia psychologic pain heel spur prevalent among females 91 51 12 respectively Rheumatoid arthritis observed 14 males 18 females respectively Prevalence MSDs high area Therefore calls action heath officials professionals plan appropriate programs prevention management MSDs society

"Nowadays, obesity is considered as a serious and growing global health problem. It is documented that the overweight and obesity are major risk factors for a series of noncommunicable diseases, and in recent years, the obesity-cancer link has received much attention. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is associated with increased risk of several cancer types, including colon, breast, endometrium, liver, kidney, esophagus, gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, and leukemia, and can also lead to poorer treatment. We review here the epidemiological and experimental evidences for the association between obesity and cancer. Specifically, we discuss potential mechanisms focusing how dysfunctional angiogenesis, chronic inflammation, interaction of proinflammatory cytokines, endocrine hormones, and adipokines including leptin, adiponectin insulin, growth factors, estrogen, and progesterone and strikingly, cell metabolism alteration in obesity participate in tumor development and progression, resistance to chemotherapy, and targeted therapies such as antiangiogenic and immune therapies.",Nowadays obesity considered serious growing global health problem documented overweight obesity major risk factors series noncommunicable diseases recent years obesitycancer link received much attention Numerous epidemiological studies shown obesity associated increased risk several cancer types including colon breast endometrium liver kidney esophagus gastric pancreatic gallbladder leukemia also lead poorer treatment review epidemiological experimental evidences association obesity cancer Specifically discuss potential mechanisms focusing dysfunctional angiogenesis chronic inflammation interaction proinflammatory cytokines endocrine hormones adipokines including leptin adiponectin insulin growth factors estrogen progesterone strikingly cell metabolism alteration obesity participate tumor development progression resistance chemotherapy targeted therapies antiangiogenic immune therapies
"T-cell response outcome is determined by co-stimulatory/inhibitory signals. Programmed cell death-1 ligand-1 (PD-L1) is a member of these co-signaling molecules with known soluble form in human serum. Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) is also recognized in patients with some types of malignancy or autoimmune disorders, though there are few studies on sPD-L1 roles in allergic diseases. The purpose of this survey was to evaluate the association between sPD-L1 levels with eosinophil count as well as disease severity in allergic rhinitis (AR) patients.",Tcell response outcome determined costimulatoryinhibitory signals Programmed cell death1 ligand1 PDL1 member cosignaling molecules known soluble form human serum Soluble PDL1 sPDL1 also recognized patients types malignancy autoimmune disorders though studies sPDL1 roles allergic diseases purpose survey evaluate association sPDL1 levels eosinophil count well disease severity allergic rhinitis AR patients

"We studied changes in blood markers of 18 nonprofessional, middle-aged runners of a 2-day, 130 km ultramarathon. Blood was sampled at baseline, after the goals on the first and second day, and at three time points (1, 3, and 5/6 days) after the race. Blood indices showed three patterns. First pattern indices showed essentially no changes after the two goals and after the race, including red blood cell indices, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Second pattern markers, including the majority of indices, were elevated during the race (and also after the race for some parameters) and then returned to baseline afterward, including hemolysis/red blood cell destruction markers (indirect bilirubin) and an iron reservoir index (ferritin), muscle damage parameters (uric acid, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase), renal function markers (creatinine and blood urea nitrogen), liver injury index (alanine aminotransferase), lipid metabolism indices (free fatty acid), reactive oxygen species and inflammation parameters (white blood cells, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein), and energy production and catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine). Third pattern index of a lipid metabolism marker - triglyceride - decreased during the race periods and started returning to baseline from then onward. Some hormonal markers such as insulin, leptin, and adiponectin showed unique patterns. These findings appeared informative for nonprofessional athletes to know about an optimal physical activity level, duration, and total exercise for elevating physical performance and monitoring physical/mental conditioning as well as for prevention of overtraining and physical injuries.",studied changes blood markers 18 nonprofessional middleaged runners 2day 130 km ultramarathon Blood sampled baseline goals first second day three time points 1 3 56 days race Blood indices showed three patterns First pattern indices showed essentially changes two goals race including red blood cell indices gammaglutamyl transferase tumor necrosis factorα Second pattern markers including majority indices elevated race also race parameters returned baseline afterward including hemolysisred blood cell destruction markers indirect bilirubin iron reservoir index ferritin muscle damage parameters uric acid creatine kinase lactate dehydrogenase aspartate aminotransferase renal function markers creatinine blood urea nitrogen liver injury index alanine aminotransferase lipid metabolism indices free fatty acid reactive oxygen species inflammation parameters white blood cells interleukin6 Creactive protein energy production catecholamines adrenaline noradrenaline dopamine Third pattern index lipid metabolism marker triglyceride decreased race periods started returning baseline onward hormonal markers insulin leptin adiponectin showed unique patterns findings appeared informative nonprofessional athletes know optimal physical activity level duration total exercise elevating physical performance monitoring physicalmental conditioning well prevention overtraining physical injuries

"Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are essential unsaturated long-chain FAs necessary for proper health and growth. The objective of the authors in this study was to evaluate the effect of fish oil supplementation in pregnancy on maternal serum FA profiles. Participants (n = 150 pregnant women aged 18-35 years in Tabriz, Iran) were randomly assigned to receive either 1,000 mg fish oil supplements daily containing 120 mg docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), or placebo from week 21 of pregnancy to delivery. The primary outcome measures were mean serum DHA and EPA proportion of total FAs at weeks 35-37 of pregnancy. Analyses were based on intention-to-treat. No significant differences were observed between the groups in consumption of fish and serum FAs levels at baseline. Fish oil supplementation significantly increased the mean DHA proportion of total FAs in the intervention compared to the placebo group at weeks 35-37 [adjusted Mean Difference (aMD) = 0.15; 95% CI 0.08-0.23]. The mean EPA proportion of total FAs also increased in the intervention group, but the difference between the groups was not significant (aMD = 0.04; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.08). The dietary recommendation for consumption of 1,000 mg/day fish oil supplements during pregnancy seems beneficial for better serum FA composition.",Omega3 fatty acids FAs essential unsaturated longchain FAs necessary proper health growth objective authors study evaluate effect fish oil supplementation pregnancy maternal serum FA profiles Participants n 150 pregnant women aged 1835 years Tabriz Iran randomly assigned receive either 1000 mg fish oil supplements daily containing 120 mg docosahexanoic acid DHA 180 mg eicosapentaenoic acid EPA placebo week 21 pregnancy delivery primary outcome measures mean serum DHA EPA proportion total FAs weeks 3537 pregnancy Analyses based intentiontotreat significant differences observed groups consumption fish serum FAs levels baseline Fish oil supplementation significantly increased mean DHA proportion total FAs intervention compared placebo group weeks 3537 adjusted Mean Difference aMD 015 95 CI 008023 mean EPA proportion total FAs also increased intervention group difference groups significant aMD 004 95 CI 001 008 dietary recommendation consumption 1000 mgday fish oil supplements pregnancy seems beneficial better serum FA composition
"Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a serious complication of solid organ transplantation that occurs due to immunosuppression and other risk factors. PTLD may present with involvement of other organs and with unusual presentation. The presentation is often extranodal (e.g., in the gastrointestinal tract, lung, or the central nervous system). Herein, we report on a 1.5-year-old girl who underwent liver transplantation almost 5 months prior to admission. She was on medications such as tacrolimus and prednisolone. Her presentation was started with symptoms of the upper respiratory infection followed by croupy cough and respiratory distress with no response to usual treatments. She had respiratory arrest during broncoscopy. Therefore, emergency tracheostomy was done. Biopsy from the paratracheal mass revealed large B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (PTLD, monomorphic and high grade). This case presentation shows that persistent upper airway symptoms, particularly stridor and croupy cough, in children who underwent liver transplant should be further evaluated; the physician needs to have a high degree of clinical suspicion for the diagnosis of PTLD in this situation.",Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder PTLD serious complication solid organ transplantation occurs due immunosuppression risk factors PTLD may present involvement organs unusual presentation presentation often extranodal eg gastrointestinal tract lung central nervous system Herein report 15yearold girl underwent liver transplantation almost 5 months prior admission medications tacrolimus prednisolone presentation started symptoms upper respiratory infection followed croupy cough respiratory distress response usual treatments respiratory arrest broncoscopy Therefore emergency tracheostomy done Biopsy paratracheal mass revealed large B cell nonHodgkin lymphoma PTLD monomorphic high grade case presentation shows persistent upper airway symptoms particularly stridor croupy cough children underwent liver transplant evaluated physician needs high degree clinical suspicion diagnosis PTLD situation

"Socioeconomic inequalities affecting health are of major importance in Europe. The literature enhances the role of social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic characteristics and urbanization, to achieve health equity. Yet, there is still much to know, mainly concerning the association between cause-specific mortality and several social determinants, especially in metropolitan areas. This study aims to describe the geographical pattern of cause-specific mortality in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (LMA), at small area level (parishes), and analyses the statistical association between mortality risk and health determinants (material deprivation and urbanization level). Fourteen causes have been selected, representing almost 60% of total mortality between 1995 and 2008, particularly those associated with urbanization and material deprivation.",Socioeconomic inequalities affecting health major importance Europe literature enhances role social determinants health socioeconomic characteristics urbanization achieve health equity Yet still much know mainly concerning association causespecific mortality several social determinants especially metropolitan areas study aims describe geographical pattern causespecific mortality Lisbon Metropolitan Area LMA small area level parishes analyses statistical association mortality risk health determinants material deprivation urbanization level Fourteen causes selected representing almost 60 total mortality 1995 2008 particularly associated urbanization material deprivation
